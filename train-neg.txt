 this is the 5th time i've asked now and not once have i been helped. why do i get kicked off xbl when i don't watch netflix
pissed bc i fell asleep watching netflix without my wifi turned on and now i only have 90% of my data left and it restarts the 20th
why would netflix decide there's a fucking audio problem 3 episodes i'm man c'mon! you wouldn't take the spoon from the fiend would you
  aaron, if you take my netflix and chill girl we are fighting tomorrow
netflix and sleep. i have to get up early tomorrow and i don't want to. i'm still recovering from t. swift.
c'mon, netflix...for nearly sucking cable tv dry and being every young adults favorite reason to procrastinate, you should have so much more
 omg i can't believe they would make another one after how terrible the 2nd one was.. is it on netflix?

my little brother comes home with nike elite socks and jordans, when i was in 6th grade i got wilson socks and clearance shoes from olympia
  i don't think nike was ever an option. part of it may be the small, inexperienced management team he's kept around.
nike didn't have what i needed so now i need to order it online and i need it tomorrow ihml
i'm going to see how long i can go without getting caught for wearing nike shorts tomorrow ..
 be careful that you're not using the same font as nike or they may say it's trademark infringement for their slogan just do it

maybe this judge is on to something..unintended consequences to make scotus listen https://t.co/mnjax4ekpo
   won't  be the 1st time scotus violated the constitution &amp; won't be the last.
   bad example she worked th since january(&amp;her mom worked there4 35 yrs) before scotus gave homos special rights
  besides i don't believe that scotus has the power to overturn state marriage laws per the 10th amendment
   however, i don't think today's scotus and fed govt would interpret the 9th that way.  9th &amp;10th have seemingly disappeared
the 1st amendment is being ignored while the new federal right to marriage equality made up by scotus (marriage... http://t.co/qtq3hg7wj1
and  article 3 gives scotus no legislative powers and the 10th amendment is clear. the 14th sec 5 requires an act of congress.
  no. congress makes laws and the scotus settles disputes. in this case, the 1st amendment lost.
thanks for hating america, scotus. i hope you all get cancer. ok, good talk. cc:   https://t.co/anhrsuuuye
  disappointed on your comment on scotus using the 14th amend to void millions of legal votes by state citizens. sad usa
suggestion - get familiar with 1st amendment.  it pretty much strikes down all scotus rulings regarding gay marriage, holiday celebrations
6th circuit &amp; scotus denied  appeals &amp; upheld bunnings order, what the heck makes her crappy lawyer think they'll do something now?
it absolutely bothers the liberals that scotus ruled the 1st amendment applies to campaign cash as founder's intended!   
    scotus violated the 10th amendment to the u.s. constitution not allowing   right
  it was the 14th that scotus ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality. news not your strong subject.
the scotus claimed under the 14th amendment they could make the same sex marriage ruling. no matter how far you stretch it isn't there.
 scotus has no authority to make law. only congress may legislate.  
 in their recent pro gay marriage decision, scotus has directly violated 9th and 10th amendments of the united states constitution.
clerk  is jailed because scotus can see gay marriage in the 14th amend. but fed.dist.judge can't see religious freedom in the 1st.
1a: congress can't make law preventing religious freedom, so scotus interpretation unlawful const trumps case law https://t.co/f4lsud5enr
the kim davis case is just a sample of what's coming  to gun owners when scotus decides it wants to redefine the 2nd amend
  what's scary is that it was only 5-4. like our scotus, irving may flip on one vote.
billy the kid - billy get your guns https://t.co/3d02aklgud via  better get it before scotus redefines the 2nd amend
 our 14th amendment is also under attack, which one do we chose? oh yeah it's up to scotus and they ruled!
 you're literally incapable of intimidating me. anyways scotus interprets the constitution. mar equality is the law of the land
  disastrous? gore was asking a state court to violate the 12th amendment, the scotus stopped them. you disapprove?
 the panthers are advocating the killing of police, scotus says that "true threats are outside the 1st amendment so why aren't
     scotus vitiated ky marriage law immediately b/c it violated 14th amendment
   hi tony. as usual u pick up the story at a convenient place in time. scotus imposed this on us 1st
 appealed bunnings original order and both the 6th circuit and scotus denied the appeals  why does she think it'll change now?
 so speaks the "soulless zombie" who fails to grasp the scotus decision was based on the 14th amendment   
  u sound like the hated "smartset" now? is  the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from scotus in history?
huckabee claims scotus made new law on ssm. no. the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment is more than a century old.
scotus cannot make law only rule on it. get real america.  unless it's healthcare.then they feel they can.    https://t.co/iymh2hbe09
scotus apparently is saying that gays have an equal right to marriage under the 14th amendment.
ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman, if scotus now writes law, guess ohio has no law and you may marry who/what you wish.
all you gun owner better get ready b/c the next thing scotus will be redefining is the 2nd amend
  judge rules that he can not issue a divorce for same sex couple because of scotus decision.  http://t.co/kds59jahd5
what's with this twitter account? it's like the seinfeld episode where they talk about themselves in the 3rd person. https://t.co/jlqizmgtzr

 serena can't fool me that 2nd set was a gift to venus. she didn't want to beat her in 2 easy sets.
 venus missed so many neutral shots in 3rd set that she never let serena feel the pressure; she let her off the hook, in a way.
 serena&gt;venus yes.  if asante samuel doesn't drop an easy int eli may not even be with giants anymore.  you are eli

paul dunne with a birdie putt on the 12th hole and just misses it. very unlucky. stays in a share of the lead at -11 with spieth 
mark james on bbc says as paul dunne is on the 17th tee let's not have anymore british out of bounds. dunne is irish not british. 
i hope paul dunne blows up tomorrow only because uab beats us in the tourney... 
it's a shame it's not a historic march up the 18th on the final sunday for paul dunne. hopefully he be in as strong a position tomorrow. ...
if you aren't rooting for paul dunne tomorrow in the open you:   a.  are not irish b.  have no soul
i guess with dj it's a sunday thing and not a final round thing, and paul dunne? are you kidding me? 
  who was the dork asking paul dunne what will be your thought in the first tee tomorrow. what a stupid question that was
dustin johnson shot the 2nd worst round of anybody in the field on a day where literally almost every player was under par, just awful
whether it's the 3rd round or 4th round dustin johnson just doesn't like sunday's in majors!!
now that dustin johnson's inevitable major sunday debacle is over, does he go -8 tomorrow since it's monday?
looking at today's play at the  you can't define dustin johnson's round as anything other than a choke. tied for 2nd worst
oddly, dustin johnson may be better served to play the final round chasing not being chased. he can play to win, not play not to lose.
must be the worse golfer of all time irish amature paul dunne teed off 6.43am thursday scheduled to finish around 7.15pm on monday!!!
after 75 today maybe i was wrong about dustin johnson getting over us open collapse. terrible 3rd rd 
saw it late but carlos gomez may have passed ryan braun in most hated baseball players
dustin johnson dealt with another major disappointment after shooting +3 &amp; going from leading after 2 at -10 to being tied for 22nd &amp; at -7

paul dunne is irish not british. i guess bbc will call him irish if he does not win tomorrow.
apparently it's not just the final round that makes dustin johnson choke it's just sunday.
  after the 2nd round, you did your usual melodramatic spew that dustin johnson was in a class of his own. same old garbage.

janet street porter shocks viewers with her comments about prince george http://t.co/pmxob4c2ue  well done jsp bang on right
i wish i was excited right now for sharknado 3. but i'm not. i'll catch it later on today, or tomorrow on my dvr.
how did sharknado get a 3rd film? how did sharknado even get a film to begin with? life doesn't make much sense.
i'm gonna watch sharknado 3 cause i have no tv shows to watch on a wednesday not cause i enjoy it.
unfollowing anyone tweeting about sharknado, may god have mercy on yr soul
sorry i can't make it in to work tomorrow got caught in a sharknado
why are sports news outlets tweeting about sharknado? i mean, c'mon. know it's the dog days, but crikes.
sharknado is the silliest film franchise so badly produced i cudnt stop laughing through the 2nd, i saw sharks flying n had to call it a day
sharknado 3 may be one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life.
may i just say the lighting in sharknado 3 could use a little work?????
sharknado was funny the first time. we humored them for the 2nd. but a third? even i'm not enough of a fan of bad movies to watch that shit.
i don't even understand how sharknado is even a thing, let alone having a 3rd movie. the se suck, the acting sucks, and it's so dumb i laugh
i dont understand the obsession with sharknado.... watched the first two and they sucked. im sure the 3rd one is just as bad.
 this is the 3rd one. check sharknado and sharknado 2 too. xd it's horrible that it's hilarious. this is a really bad movie.
sharknado may well be the flat out dumbest thing ever to occupy a tv screen.
so wait, twitter decides if april lives or dies? it doesn't make sense... but then my husband reminded me this is sharknado. 
this  race is seriously getting out of hand. who in the blue heck is john kasich? or red heck, as the case may be here.

i am not in the right frame of mind to attempt to watch sharknado 3 yet. i may need to start drinking.
 tag is like watching sharknado in the 3rd dimension.
a 60 mile flame burning hotter than the surface of the sun!?!  come on sharknado, that is even ridiculous for you.
just finished watching sharknado 3. it was so silly that it was decent, especially the ending. can't believe they're making a 4th one now!
i may not be much in this world, but i'll never be as awful as a 21-year-old who acts like they enjoy the musical stylings of nirvana.

 are you kidding me? i want to replace my old phone with moto g 3rd gen at any cost. do anything. it's not my fault.
all those who petitioned for stopping yakub's hanging , may hang themselves ...this would be the best  "shraddhanjali" to him
 it seems that pmk leader may be wrongly advised about yakub acts.pmk leader may think that he is patriot.

nicki's butt is just too big like c'mon that's not even fun anymore like
nicki's pastor is mad af right now. and it's sunday smh

  i feel like i planned my whole day wrong. i gotta get ready for class tomorrow. but i jusr t wanna watch nicki
the sad part about this is tomorrow nicki will be the angry black woman who went after poor white girl miley
tbh if tomorrow ppl start going after nicki for what she said im gonna be pissed
i should really stop watching big brother: after dark cause it's only sunday and i already know the nominees and who won the veto...
i thought this may have been entertaining after nicki's moment but it's actually very painful
miley.. you better watch out for nicki backstage she may throw hands
i wish nicki would have flew across the stage and slapped that hoe !  https://t.co/d9dtrkezji

literally so annoyed with everyone on kanye west's weenie... he's just another celebrity puppet and you all fall for it? c'mon
seriously kanye west is the biggest joke ever. the burrito i am gonna get at moe's tomorrow would be a better president.
what even is kanye west and who gave him a mic? i'll probs wake up tomorrow and he'll still be talking
kinda sad you're not doing a liveshow this tuesday to talk about why kanye west is the kanye best :( 
that was the most unintelligible horseshit i've ever sat through...kanye west is about as fun to listen to as jimmy from south park 
george bush doesn't care about black people kanye west, sept 2 2005  "i have decided to run for president in 2020" kanye west, aug 30 2015
white feminism will be all over the newspapers tomorrow saying how nicki attacked miley. that's you call someone out!!!!
if you think kanye west would be a good president you probably scored below a 1000 on your sat
if kanye west comes even close to winning the 2020 election, like 5th place or higher, i'm leaving the country for canada
this ain't the 1st day i've ever called nicki ignorant, fuck. i'm on and off w/ her. its simple, &amp; i don't always like how she handle shit.
a no no, kanye announces he's running for president, and nicki gets crazy with miley all in the the same night.. it's sunday wtf
i may have just dropped two letter grades of intelligence after listening to that kanye west rant...
i hate you kanye west and if you become president u may be assassinated, i hope
kanye west, 4th member of the new day. kan-ye sucks.
scott walker thinks building a wall between the us &amp; anything is legitimate. his wall dreams will cost taxpayers an arm, leg &amp; 1st born.
i really wish i was going to ed sheeran this saturday :'(((
lost some respect for nicki after that. you may be a queen in the rap world but when u start shit at an award show u look like garbage 
watching some crap called "big brother". okay. i may have been out of the loop for some time now but,... wtf!!
i think this is seriously the worst song i have ever heard. and i've sat through a bunch of kanye west performances at these shows.

what makes me sad is how tomorrow morning, the media is gonna portray nicki as the stereotypical "angry black woman" &amp; make miley the victim
 3rd: bad blood won video of the year and she took all the women in the video up w her and said stupid shit
 she may be a """"problematic fave"""" but there's no reason for her to be getting dragged just cuz nicki said some shit
a possibility that kanye west may be president someday in the future, i will go off.
why is nicki always calling someone out on stage .. bitch looks so trashy while miley just sat there and took what she said with class
kanye west running for president? trump actually being popular? what the fuck? this isn't reality. this is a saturday morning cartoon.

 i still think it was fake. i always thought nicki to be the type to call you out on a random tuesday, not at an awards show
kanye west saying he's running for president may be the single most ridiculous thing i've ever heard
and tomorrow nicki is going to be seen as "a raging angry black women" for calling miley out of something that she is guilty for
hahahhaha depressed af. i leave the 7th. jack and jack come on the 9th and shawn on the 8th hahahaha kill me
 nicki can't even get her 3rd album to go gold lmfao  nicki copies off kim's old shit, kim was the first female with --
kanye west may in fact be the biggest douche bag in the history of the universe
real shit vote kanye for president if he really is doing it , can't stand donald trump and kane's my 2nd dad
i may joke, but nicki's totally valid points about a racist system will be forgotten again because of a white woman's comments
i'm tweeting this for the 2nd time, nicki needs to realize that people don't buy her music not because she isn't "skinny and white"+
talk about illuminati! kanye west for president? please tell me we find out it was a pr stunt tomorrow..

furthermore, the 14th amendment was ratified in the 1800's when homosexuality was illegal. clearly then it's not aimed at gay marriage.

not the best start to the 2nd set from murray, but our print editor is more focused on the fact that apparently both players "look scruffy"
murray's serve broken in 1st service game 2nd set. i'm not watching any more. he does my  head in at times doing everything the hard way!
murray a set down and 3-0 down in the 2nd set and bookies are laying murray at evens? ridiculous
 murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing djokovic
 picking  mvp in july is stupid ..wow were you marking off the days on your i luv kris bryant calendar to retweet this ? lol
if murray loses this 2nd set i'm pretty sure he won't win this.
murray's in major crisis here - 5 - 1 down in the 2nd set after losing the 1st! scenes!!
soooo jealous of everyone going to the ed sheeran concert tomorrow
murray with a splendid array of swear words at the end of the 2nd set. sitting there with the commentator having to say, "sorry.  sorry."
woeful start to the 3rd from murray. think this is lights out for him.
murray in real trouble now, down a break in the 3rd  looking angry and frustrated
murray always struggles on louis armstrong. how pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to  lose his mini break in the 1st?
andy broken to start the 3rd set; still complaining to chair ump that 5 minutes is excessive bathroom usage time. murray's so done. 
murray about as dead as the aliens in independence day on july 4th in  they die in the movie either way but worse on the 4th. 
murray is pissed here and in the march! hope he pulls it off 
i'm sad i feel like i'm going to get bad seats tomorrow with my luck &amp; idk if z100 called the ppl for who's going to sit on stage for shawn
it sucks that i'm not even excited for the  theme tune debuting tomorrow, if it is sam smith it will really dampen my excitement.
murray misses a good chance to break at the start of the 4th. sloppy along with a brilliant shot from anderson denies the break. 
part of me hopes abbott does it b/c i believe it will blow up in his face if he singles out christians. it may take time for him to see why
with school starting tomorrow i'm gonna be missing out on so much with zayn this makes me so sad
so mad i have school this week... if i didn't i would be in nyc because shawn has a show tomorrow and the jacks have one the day after

tell me if 14th can be used for gay marriage then why wasn't it used for     
 also, the red sox do not have a challenge. they lost it in the 9th. this shouldn't be reviewed.
the red sox have completely fallen apart here in the 10th
gujarat government may even claim that the quran says killing muslims is rewarding. 
this is why the red sox are last place in the division. poor defence in this 10th inning 
did the red sox get bambino cursed heading into the 10th or what? ball off glove, balk, wild pitch! 
 i pre-ordered the taken king digital collector's edition for both the ps3 and ps4 in july and i didn't receive anything today... :(
 may i also remind you milan  was one the original clubs punished in the scandle
brooke and i sat in christians driveway today for 10 minutes and he wasn't even home :(
red sox in that 10th inning looked like a group of minimum wage employees who were asked to stay past the end of their shift. 
the only bad thing about the  streak is that david wright may injure himself from celebrating so hard so often
tomorrow i'm gonna lock myself in my room and not be on social media all day bc i don't want to see any posts about ed sheeran concert :(((

so hype to give a presentation in management class tomorrow about why tom brady can go fuck himself
 i dunno. kentucky's legislature never approved gay marriage, 10th amendment leaves it to the states. how's that hard?
i want to see shawn so bad tomorrow, i am so freaking depressed
 my point was that just your fathers fear of islam may actually stem from its similarities to judaism
i do not like kanye west. yes i may like a few of his songs but other than that he's an idiot

well it may not be 1:30am, but the red sox lost 5-1, my little brother got carsick, and most importantly it's way past my bedtime.
 i sat in the old yankees' bleachers pre-2003 in red sox shit, and i would never make anyone carry me and slow ped. traffic.
nope. so-called "christians" like yourself denying the equal protection of the law under the 14th amendment. 
  i hear what your saying but if there was peace tomorrow the muslims would still be killing the minority groups.
and pakistan calls itself the protector of muslims when on the contrary it's deeds are grossly unislamic https://t.co/xwjmonghse

wow  may be the worst idea since hitler decided to invade russia. i'd genuinely rather listen to george osborne. &amp; i loathe him.

floyd mayweather fights saturday and nobody cares at all because he picked a shit opponent and the fight can't even sell all the tickets lol
haven't seen tfi friday before but it's hosted by noel fielding and chris evans (the shit, english one) so i want it off television soon
is noel fielding having a chat on tfi friday or is chris evans going to keep on rabbiting another break "groan"!!!
lol, get a grip  fans. i can forgive the hrs, but he biffed that pitch to thor and then fell apart in the 4th https://t.co/5vyhq69iqn
i have an uneasy feeling..last 2 times i felt this way was day before the attitude article &amp; when briana came to london..i may be wrong tho
thursday is thor's day and i'm sore from the thunder of stress that i'm under
i don't understand the narrative that thor owned the game because of that first pitch. the royals got to him in the 1st &amp;  2nd, right?
 if escobar was hurt i would hope you would be calling for thor's suspension. if kc throws up tomorrow, you should have no prob
having a really hard time processing that connor howell sat on the curtis side at the game last night.
 be honest, if ventura had thrown 1st pitch like thor you all would be blasting him instead drooling on yourself? 
curtis is right:  forwards coasting back to the d zone is not a formula for success. 3rd line didn't distinguish itself there.
i may well need therapy for what that guy just did to one of my all time favourite david bowie songs... wtf was that!!!  
tfi friday was good in the 90s because it was new and chris evans was young.  someone needs to tell him this is crap and dated.
i like moose but he should stop bitching about the thor pitch. fuck escobar, that's one way to get him back o stop swinging at the 1st pitch
well now all the pre-teen aged girls who were thinking of paying money to go watch thor or kong at the movies are going to have 2nd thoughts
outsider's perspective to dark souls: you die a lot and masturbate to the sun.
the worst part about  being over may actually be that tonight was the last time i'll see thor and captain america's abs. 
 it may not be the best idea but *some* action is needed. school kids should not be calling for charlie hebdo to die 
 chris evans should lose his voice more often if it means we get more listenable breakfast shows like this monday and tuesday's.
alright if you hate briana ok but like just ignore her don't call her names just leave her be if we ignore this it may just leave
unless briana was as virgin- the only thing i can tell  is dna test! she wouldn't be the 1st trying 2 trap a celebrity...
just saying briana got pregnant when she had a bf in march/april and louis and eleanor had just broken up isn't that just fishy
ok but louis hasnt been seen with briana since like what march ???? he is never with her and he looks so uncomfortable when interviewers+
paps: this one if for the sun!! briana: *stands behind louis and poses*  so not set up, nope nope nope, not one bit
in the paparazzi video where they take cliche for the sun you can clearly see louis not realising that there's briana behind him
briana may be pregnant but louis isnt the dad or atleast he is not excited about it you can obviously see it when he's been asked about it
so briana is allowed to smoke but not allowed to take photos by fans because it may affect the baby okay then.
 dark souls is pretty much near the bottom of the list for me to finish, along with many many rpgs,gotta get thru short ones 1st

waste time, just like watching on friday and she said chris evans birthday yesterday and
 i'm supposed to be fling out to sharm on tuesday. i'm fed up of this. i went to paris a few days after the charlie hebdo attack
charlie hebdo may quite rightly enjoy freedom of speech, but to mock the deaths of over 200 people? i think they have crossed a line
the rejuvenation of tfi friday, ergo giving chris evans the opportunity to appear on tv more, is very disheartening.
amy schumer is on sky atlantic doing one of the worst stand up sets i have ever seen. and i've almost sat through 30 seconds of millican.
watching tfi friday, wtf has chris evans done, has he had surgery? just doesn't look right, grow old gracefully fella!!

last face you want to see on remembrance sunday is tony blair, lying, horrible, corrupt twat. bush's bitch
i hope tony blair feels shit standing there at remembrance sunday, cause he's partly to blame for the deaths or so many soldiers in iraq
tony blair has a cheek being at remembrance sunday, seeing as he illegally sent many young men to their death illegally in iraq.
how can tony blair get invited at 'remembrance' sunday and there was no invite for the merchant navy by david cameron ? 'disgusting'!
tho i respect his decision, i don't agree with it. james mcclean may not necessarily be a supporter of ira. he said the poppys stand for ...
on remembrance sunday my primary thought is of this very day in 1987-when the ira tried 2 murder members of my family for daring to remember
 i know for sure that briana's baby is not louis' ! he may have had sex with her but she did also with someone else sooo..m
tony blair may be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, but at least he bowed low enough, eh?

all three gunmen in the january attacks on the charlie hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket were french.
why does tony blair get the right to be invited to remembrance sunday?
you can tell i'm off my meds by the fact that i'm sat in the dark listening to david bowie
 my old building was blown up by the ira. on the 10th anniversary they called in a bomb in a bin outside.
everybody is responding to that trump tweet but its from january during the charlie hebdo shootings... still not cool but pls check the date
well done chris evans, i did not think it was possible to make tfi friday any more shit than it used to be, but you have proved me wrong
 you may recall how bad it was when the same people had charlie hebdo to blame for their own massacre.
  those that impose!! tony blair has made it clear in his apology but no icc for him ne.1st world warlords,teflon don
criticizing her lack of preparedness isn't wrong. ira's post didn't say it was.   https://t.co/8fwadjh8tm

the fact i probably won't see them again before march makes me want to cry  the vamps
 if rahul gandhi is really a british citizen, i'm very concerned about the comedians out there. they may be without jobs
 the ira terrorised the uk for years as well! what a load of shit the sun is.
didn't show up for charlie hebdo march.  didn't light up wh in blue/white/red.  late to moment of silence.  but his heart is in it, america.
like  apology, tomorrow when british a'thority will regret abt the error in rahul gandhi's nationality, will media show that?
the mp leaders should be arrange a march to congress office if they didn't take any action against rahul gandhi about his dual citizenship
 hello its called dana white losing a massive amount of money because he put it all on ronda.  people lost their shirts sat.
 you are a bitter man! who brought about the good friday agreement. did he manage that without talking to ira interests?
thor's powers are so inconsistent in mcu. in the first movie he took out the destroyer in one hit. 2nd one he's struggling with a dark elf.
  terror in paris...in january not just charlie hebdo unless dead jews don't count.

shoot to kill was a gift to the ira, who were nothing pre bloody sunday. if you're a lab mp &amp; don't know this, get a new job 
  i don't think la mon was an economic or military target. so why did the ira bomb, who were the targets?
    refugee's did not carry out the charlie hebdo or the paris attacks on friday, you prejudice idiot.
 no less ridiculous than any of the thor movies by marvel. or melinda may beating up any guy on agents of shield
if distributions are not large enough, the ira owner may have to pay a 50% penalty on amounts not distributed https://t.co/ptcvyuohdw
 they haven't do that right after the february attacks, against charlie hebdo do you remember ?
 says  had a "rationale" for the charlie hebdo killings in january (pic of muhammad), but friday night in paris was different
and i thought he was a relativist. "kerry sees 'rationale' in charlie hebdo murders, unlike friday's attacks in paris"
the fact he sees the rationale of charlie hebdo attack is why his policies are impotent against isis https://t.co/lioj3kmjgh
so john kerry said this today and saturday i asked why no outrage over the charlie hebdo terrorist attack: they deserved it?
anyone who thinks lady gaga and tony bennett are a weird pairing, may i remind you of david bowie and bing crosby?

kerry can see the rationale behind the charlie hebdo attack. fairly disgusting  https://t.co/q7jcyu7lbw
 nothing fair about it. it was mostly unarmed civilians who were murdered, by the ira, the uvf, &amp; by 1 para on bloody sunday
dana white is a terrible promoter sometimes. instead of praising holm her for her performance, he says rousey had a bad night? c'mon man.
 what about the victims of ira terrorism david, do you ever think of them? kingsmill, le mon or even kevin mcguigan
prithviraj chauhan defeated ghori 2 times and left him alive.but the 3th time ghori killed him. rahul gandhi caught 2 times by nda . 3rd ?
yeah,  said the charlie hebdo attacks may have had "legitimacy" or at least a "rationale." dude needs to stop.

what confuses me is that briana was literally fuckin pulled out of louis' ass in like may and like 2 weeks later she was pregnant 1+1=76

funny corbyn worries innocent people may be killed in syrian war but doesn't care about the people the ira killed https://t.co/ktrwzdqysw
  part of me suspects corbyn may march on his own party hq with stw &amp; blame it on tony blair. you never know.
 yo dicko!! it was pure sectarian bigotry from the ira councillor which started this in the 1st place !!
  no the ira grew out of oppression &amp; internment &amp; bloody sunday &amp; ballymurphy &amp; kids killed by rubber bullets &amp;
if tony blair pipes up tomorrow someone shoot him. actually maybe he should and that will turn the vote!
 but the point is that corbyn's sympathy for ira is not relevant in deciding whether to vote same way as him tomorrow

 curtis good isn't good enough for the scottish 2nd division mate - another terrible buy to go with all of the rest.
 i have a dislike of several labour mp's over their attitude to the ira &amp; so it may be the reason it first came to me.
the biggest victory for the ira was bloody sunday. membership surged. bombing syria will only do the same. membership of isis will rocket.
  not support. they said need to talk to those groups to end conflict, as uk gov did with ira. please stop believing sun.

kendrick lamar killed j.cole in the black friday aswr.
sometimes i wonder how kendrick lamar doesn't suffer from 3rd degree burns in his mouth with how he's always spitting fire 
we want to bomb syria like there's no tomorrow, but when will we finally jail tony blair and george bush for their war crimes? 
sat here and tried to listen to kendrick lamar because as much i do slander, i still try to see the appeal. he still wack to me
 deeply inspired by david bowie - ashes to ashes and pink floyd, set the controls for the heart of the sun = depressing game
 as for the ira, he talked to them publicly while thatcher was doing it behind our backs. without corbyn, no good friday.

i'm bummed with amazon prime right now. i ordered something and it was supposed to be delivered today, but it wasn't and i leave tomorrow :(
 i've had several problems with amazon prime - customer service has been a nightmare especially if your items are from 3rd party vendor
i'm kind of confused why my amazon prime stuff that shipped today isn't coming until the 19th-24th. that's certainly not two days.
arriving tuesday is decidedly the least prime my amazon prime shipping has ever been. wha happen?
because the answer is wednesday and that is very soon and i'm still not packed (also my amazon prime order didn't arrive today wtf)
the one time we want to use the amazon prime streaming and it's down... grrr ruined my sunday night! 
such a retard! somehow managed to get another trial for amazon prime and i've forgot to cancel it for a 2nd time
great, my cables have now been bumped from being delivered today to friday. thanks amazon prime, really feeling the worth here.
ordered 3 amazon prime items yesterday. one will arrive saturday (2 days!), another sunday (3 days?), the third on tuesday (5 days???).
yeah, i know it's sunday delivery &amp; whatnot - and who else does that?! - but my amazon prime package is 3 and a half hours late... so far...
amazon prime is a lie. it said my stuff would be delivered by monday. its wednesday, and still hasn't arrived. tracking doesn't make sense.
finally broke down and got amazon prime and the delivery on my 1st purchase as a member is late.  i was expecting better.

before george r. r. martin finishes the next book, some of the game of thrones actors may die of natural causes. take your time george.
i've sat through five seasons of game of thrones and i still couldn't tell you a single characters name.
watching the 1st series of game of thrones is bringing back painful memories
  had cpl 10-3 seasns but c'mon now,doesnt take a genius to google how bad you guys were.osu never been that bad
  lol - 1st off it'd be wah-zee. israeli start up - dev in '08...sold to google maps in '12 for $1.1bil.

  hey, idiot. too bad. you have lost. you may have read about the scotus decision? obergefell? google that . . .
   hadn't read the full thread on 1st reply. i forgot people might not know google isn't live results.
i think google may be worried that if they allow people just to add sites on google now, then people will use it like google reader.
that moment when you think google search ads for that distortion pedal showed up on your twitter feed. nope. https://t.co/nvmkbn3pjo

twitter on sunday in nz is a fucking hellmouth of talking about awful shitty reality tv - i'll just watch this grateful dead doc

it's grateful dead night at the stadium tomorrow. i don't think anybody's grateful for that. -mike shannon 
after a disappointing end to the 3rd season of oitnb, now to see what hannibal is all about.
 noooo not yet. we had a birthday date night last night. plus i watch it on hulu, which means no hannibal until sunday :/
according to my dvr, the penultimate episode of hannibal is just the 4th quarter of a nfl preseason game. i could eat a face.
i thought i had enough strength for the hannibal finale. tomorrow is lost.
 i think it's hannibal and clarice on the run together, which i loathed, but bryan's talk of an "inversion" may make it work
hannibal's 3rd season feels like it became more and more a parody of itself.
bit concerned my brother hasn't read the facebook message i sent him asking him to bring me the last 2 episodes of hannibal tomorrow.
sorry, harper, but for once just take the blame. nats' blew the game.  https://t.co/cqlmq9cofs
    goldschimdt? for leading a last place team? harper? may not even make the playoffs lol
what a tool  is once again - fans leaving in the 7th inning in washington today is brutal.period. no reason to go after harper.
but hey, if you're mad at harper, go to the game tomorrow and tell him how you feel for all 9 innings
isis took last oilfield syria. harper's 3 bombing runs  may kill civilians not the problem or cause. http://t.co/u37nfqwz9z  
if harper doesn't want fans to leave in the 7th perhaps he and his teammates should stop under performing and losing big ball games? 
choosing to read the transcript of the interview mansbridge did with harper due to the extreme 2nd hand embarrassment i'm bound to endure
 i feel it is 2nd rate. mansbridge doesn't point out when harper's not answering the question. debaters would do that.
 let's go easy on the pigs. i just can't stand the sight of harper. it's the 21st century...can't we teach robots to love?
 harper the cpc are going to become a 3rd place party because of your reckless leadership   
harper, you may not think justin's ready, but urine over your head.
news in the  commuters face "terrible traffic tuesday"; 6 shot, 1 fatally, in 2 dc shootings; hot, 93; nats lose, harper calls out fans
 harper &amp; cabal insult the intelligence of canadians on a daily basis. tired of all the lies &amp; spin. roll on oct 19th! 
of many single issue reasons to reject harper. this is one. imagine the cost of removing all that concrete.   https://t.co/htwphozgot
does harper even realize there in 3rd place! talk about burying you head in the sand... stay the course... of lies and deceit! 
 trudeau may do better if he attacked the ndp, no need to waste time on harper the media is 24/7 with the anti harper narrative
new election laws crreated by cpc makes it difficult to vote against harper even w/ 70% of voters against harper, he may still win 
so harper is blaming del mar racing another meet for the summer meet's struggle.  never change california racing.
cpc polling 3rd. hate polls but i want to believe this. as individual cpc candidates come to realize that harper is drag to them, distnce?
  yellow journalism.  but you know?  this may be harper's waterloo
harper's new ad i am who i am not perfect but depend on me for economy  harper slip sliding down the polls-3rd we know who you are scares us
anyone in niagara tomorrow should note that harper will be in welland. the sulfuric smell won't be coming from the netherby tunnel for once.
 he could, but harper has been a freak all year, and votto's 1st half wasn't amazing.
 at any rate harper is sinking fast he is talking resignation after 19 oct.
 i hope someone asks harper why the team bailed in the 7th inning
shame all the fans that stuck around to see a six run lead blown and harper make an out for the 8th time in two games. 
harper may never get a hit against the mets the rest of his career 
 even a successful bunt puts us right they are now 1st and 2nd 1 out after the ibb to harper. so dumb.
 in this series the nationals may have lost the division and harper may have lost the mvp.
 mulcair, trudeau and may are all weaklings just like harper. mulcair must dubious and dangerous of bunch. apologist for isis.
    harper will be at 20% or less on oct 19.jenni byrne is merely a symptom of the problem  
armed with the tools of power &amp; intimidation harper is trying to steal our country.  on october 19th, armed with pencils let's take it back.
harper:ndp or liberal govt possible harper's spirit broken tired of so much hate against him of his own making given up the ghost peace mon
 force out at 2nd was the first out, then the walk to harper, then dp.  yea terrible managing.
 journey to isis. harper is a dangerous man. for all our sake i hope he goes. ours is early nov but i can vote during ++
 the "harper doesn't hustle" narrative was born, and will endure, b/c of one dumb decision matty's 1st month on the job
ctv report harper's troubled campaign may result in the dumping of his campaign manager jenni byrne   https://t.co/od1al1dzwx
i'm sat watching the worst harry potter film ugh
you'd think i'd be prepared for all the anguish when reading the harry potter books all over again for the 10th time. right? like fuck.
the pacing for the 4th harry potter movie was so ridiculously off and it ruined the entire movie.
hey, can you set up apple tv so i can watch harry potter while i get fucked up? --ladies and gentlemen, may i introduce you to my roomies!
 if you think harry potter is better ur not gunna survive as an adult lol honestly though when i went to logan 3rd was the best
everytime i watch the 4th harry potter, a part of me still thinks that maybe cedric will return to the port-key... but he never does *cries*
we're sat by the thames and orally retelling harry potter and the philosophers stone. i am the worst at this game.

 you're floyd may weather and i'm 50 cent don't make me force you to read full sentences from harry potter
hillary doesn't want to run as bill's 3rd term. biden doesn't want to run as obama's 3rd term. both want to run as sanders's 1st term.
 hillary's aides say alot of things - except the one taking the 5th. 
 may not be my first choice for president, but i'm voting for him if he's nominated. at least he's better than hillary
hillary whacker  rehashes the same article he wrote 6 weeks ago. not one new fact in sept 7 piece.
 and  may have used benghazi lie to win his last election but the   will lose hillary's http://t.co/iu2kldkbxs
this will be the 3rd "revamp" of hillary's campaign. her numbers tank each time. she just sucks at campaigning in the new media world.
 wait till hillary throws you under the bus like the rest. pleading the 5th?
 this must be the 20th time this old advice to hillary has been recycled as "news."  she is who she is. that's her problem.

hillary is the washington establishment, say whatever it takes to get elected. we need a change up... it may not be me but elect someone
 remember how nyt aided bush's march to iraq war?  they need to be truthful &amp; they haven't with hillary.
but on friday she refused to apologize in interview with liberal hack andrea mitchell. hillary is a phony.  
if you're bored, ask siri, "hillary sucks big green donkey dicks" prepare to laugh like you were in 8th grade!!
u know hillary is panicking when chelsea clinton will be speaking at the amy schumer show in boston this friday.
this may or may not be true but it doesn't change the fact that hillary violated the law
hillary gets emotional over talking about her mother -  tomorrow  will call her a fake. 
 this why people don't believe anything hillary say this person will soon take the 5th
   omgosh! hillary still using her deceased mom as a prop to save herself from her own lies. ~may she rip.
hillary apologizes the way kardashians wed--several times in quick succession &amp; never sincerely.

hillary: so all i have to do is have an unsecured server with national secrets on it, and i'll win? cooooool!!! https://t.co/e3rs53qmbz
hillary will not make history as 1st female pres. she'll make history by being 1st pres candidate to be indicted on criminal charges.
 or hillary or sanders.  we may have to rethink this whole democracy thing if someone does not step up after the pre-season. :d
you may not have seen, but the left loves their liars, cheats &amp; traitors. hillary is their perfect candidate! https://t.co/rp2z1upkwm
hillary just may be that stupid, look at some of her track record screw ups. history tells it all. https://t.co/nzgqhxontl
 also, hillary may begin to give the perception that perhaps she may tend to allow herself to be portrayed as less than accurate.
  hillary is sorry now that she may be facing criminal charges for what they found in her email
 i hear that hillary's authenticity czar is going on the sunday shows.
wait. people claim hillary is showing her humanity because she chokes up talking about her dead mother? that may be the lowest bar ever.
did anyone see hillary's server boy actually plead the 5th or did his lawyers only do this in the media?   
hillary can take her phony apology and shove it where the sun doesn't shine. she is only sorry she was caught it's all about power.
  hillary's 1st tele news explan "the server i used was set up by the secret service 4 the pres" y 4gotten???
secret service was at my house for hillary's visit tomorrow. quote of the day from one: "if you see the agents start to run - you run too".

this is starting to feel like less like a petting zoo &amp; more like jurassic park.  ~me at the strip club for lunch on a wednesday
one of the summer's biggest questions: when did we start acting like jurassic park was an all time classic and not 2nd tier spielberg?
so i've found at least 3 different typos in jurassic park since i started reading it. c'mon how long has this book been out?
im so bored i dont want to watch jurassic park for the hundredth time, i just want it to fucking be sunday already..
sitting here watching jurassic park: the lost world and remembering why the 1st one is my favorite. 
i'm all for exploring but this look like the island from jurassic park lll i may have to skip  https://t.co/zpquacvtkd
fuck a saturday class i just wanna go home and play with our squirrel and watch jurassic park
fuck me i took so long to watch jurassic park and kept pausing it and then i sat on the remote and it changed channels and now its live tv
stayed up late to watch jurassic world and i just remembered i have a football match tomorrow morning :/
i have the worst urge to watch jurassic world for the 4th time in theaters someone make it stop
we tried to watch jurassic world and watched like an 8th and the internet died on us :(
sat through jurassic world w/ a screaming baby in my ear + a 6 year old climbing up the back of my chair. ruined my experience 
  tru....i may still need to glance it...because jurassic world straight sucked
 plus i may have hurt the feelings of jurassic world's director! https://t.co/q8r70uuk8n
 yeah i loved the 1st film and book. was disappointed with jurassic world (but i seem to be in a minority)
justin has been my bitch since the 6th grade
i hope justin's concert thursday gets cancelled bc of the thunder storm thats supposed to happen
 justin's girl, lost the baby!she was due the 20th... and then placenta had burst inside of her, and the baby wasn't receiving air
i don't see why justin thinks it's okay to work tuesday's.. it's fall were supposed to get $1 burgers at bar louie and blackout
 i'll share 1st. i don't care for c-lud because of her weird crush on justin and how sorority girl she comes across. ur turn!
 justin, i think you got that backwards. see my sep 3 post on obamanomics outpacing daugaardonomics: http://t.co/hywrzts4b0
justin is lost in the 1st minute. no experience 
i'm going to fight justin tomorrow during lunch idc idc dc
when the *nsync account tweets "tomorrow night they're together again," i want the "they're" to be *nsync.  not justin and jimmy.
probably going to complain another 20 times today about how justin performs on the today show tomorrow when i start school
i need to see justin tomorrow at the today show but i can't skip class :(
it's justin's funeral tomorrow, it was a pleasure to have known and worked with such a great racer. rip badass   https://t.co/hfconcj4vz
i really wish i didn't have work or school tomorrow bc i'd so be in the city to see justin right now fuck my life
lucian favre having 2nd thoughts about gladbach qualifying for the champions league - juventus, man city and sevilla. group of death.
87 years of italian serie a history produced a first for juventus on sunday: they lost at home on the opening day of the season
 how much more? (to be clear i hate juventus) but this move doesn't make sense. they may offer 40 million to reach a deal so quickly
consult a dr. if you will watch the 2nd half of swansea vs manutd over roma vs juventus match @ 7:00
only going by the latest game stats but think i may have made a mistake backing juventus
as things stand, the bottom 3 in serie a are bologna (18th), empoli (19th); and juventus (20th).
this is very bad for juventus. lose in the 1st &amp; 2nd gionarta? something wrong with formation i think.. miss pirlo, tevez &amp; vidal already :(
juventus hopeless without their 3 key players and a poor transfer window. hope the cunts end up 5th in the league.
juventus had two men sent off as their dismal start to defending their serie a title continued with defeat at roma on sunday.
de rossi believes juventus may struggle to cope this season as he does not think they have adequately replaced tevez, pirlo or vidal
if draxler news is true, juventus has been humiliated this transfer window. may be leaving without the trequartista they need and 0-2.
 what was the reason u did  not ask questions in the kerry interview  sat in silence when u speak it is only to mock the right
 iran may regret it. but only if it happens under a gop president after obama and kerry are gone.
obama's agenda was 2 destroy american exceptionalism &amp; kerry is just dumb. what language does iran speak? we may need 2 learn it  
  never have, never will; scumbag mbh lowlife pos maybe, but never pres. i hope the 1st iran nuke hits him &amp; kerry.
 yes they do &amp; its sad that kerry being the 1st aa woman in 40 yrs to b lead on a show was reduced to a guest star on her on show
no, sam. the "we" in kerry's statement is unhcr, not the us government. important distinction.  https://t.co/pinomw6qbx
never been a kerry fan but may they hammer 7 shites into dublin and wipe the smile off their smug little faces!

  that's right, ladies. i'm blaming everything on kerry. cleo this show may well eclipse the numbers of 
   may i ask, have you read the bill, including the provisions that neither congress nor kerry saw?
 i think everyone is having trouble with it by the sounds of it kerry. c'mon  sort it out please
 went to qf with kerry lad who before game hoped that dubs would not beat kerry by a cricket score. game over in 1st 10 mins cute
  we may elect to forget famous iran contra then under bush till he declared axis of evil every one failed kerry did
americans taken hostage by iran houthis back in march ..kerry kept it quiet while iran deal was being negotiated  so americans would approve

funny how arsenal fans were all appalled by the galatasaray fans behaviour wednesday yet, today they did the exact same thing 
my mama paying for that dumb ass hulu shxt she may as well get netflix.
kobe bryant smiling as he re-enters the game with the lakers losing 91-63 in the 4th quarter. probably insanity settling in.
  i may have been watching old episodes on netflix as we endure the never ending wait for it to be released !
we're playing hull tomorrow and arsenal haven't put a picture of the fa cup on the programme cover. chance missed.
i just sat here and watch   snap about kobe bryant  i'm too done   should know better
  shutup you fat inbred hypocritical slut. i hope you and everyone who works for the sun get ebola. you fat pig.
if selena will release the single next monday with taylor's new song she can kiss  on itunes goodbye
 agreed. but another sec loss makes it awfully hard for the tigers to play in the georgia dome on dec. 6. two more: lights out
arsenal's season is a mess. they're losing the battle for their favourite 4th place position
 still havnt got my 6months netflix subscription from the 28th of august....
omg  play on monday night football,  times makes me kill my self right now..  f*** off you liverpool, city, arsenal and chelsea

aside from the cl final of 05, the 07 game against arsenal, 2nd leg was the most stressful game i can think of
february 8th: cleveland 147, los angeles lakers 79. kobe bryant looked angry a lot in this game and byron scott started weeping in the third

ugh just learned a gilmore girls spoiler. does it still count as a spoiler if a show has been off the air for the life-span of a 1st grader?
flares!! after all the booing and jeering towards the galatasaray fans on wednesday night? fucking hypocrites   
trying to watch ahs at a bar and the sun is just hating me
funny cause  the arsenal fans booed the galatasaray end on wednesday for letting off flares. now they've done it in the concourse.
you may be shocked to learn that kobe bryant does not agree with espn ranking him the nba's 40th best player. video: http://t.co/f7esddkpgw
1st question: why haven't we closed the borders? 2. why mr. duncan wasn't transfer to any hospital that can handle ebola? 
galatasaray led by 3 after the 1st quarter but has gotten smoked, getting outscored 27-10 through the 1st 10 minutes

 because he didn't warrant a higher pick while at michigan. look at russell wilson i think he was taken in the 4th
 i really don't see what you see in vettel... care to share. the guy may be 4 time wdc but he's not that great
i couldn't remember if the boys did c'mon c'mon on wwa tour then i remember shouting out the lyrics when people didn't know what song it was
 he may not be preaching it but it is the result of him appearing on shows like bill maher. this itself is dangerous.
i'm going to be soo tired when i wake up tomorrow and i have to be at school tomorrow early i want to kms
 i couldn't go watch the wwa film cause the 11th was my birthday and i'm sad because of this.

bill maher is the perfect example of how gross and ignorant liberal idols may be
three hours of sleep would be a lot worse if it was monday. it's a sugar free red bull breakfast morning.  
school tomorrow just killed the awesome vibe i was just in
  he led us nowhere (got past the bulls in the 2012 1st rd. with rose out) wouldn't have been close if he was in
school tomorrow just isn't gonna work for me
 have sacked russell wilson something like 16 times in his career. they don't record a sack this sunday and it's time for....mutiny
if i don't go to school tomorrow then it's carters fault 
oh.. i'm sorry, matt adams took madbum deep in the 4th to make it 3-2 cards? please tell me again he's better than kershaw. 
in retrospect, the prefunk nap and midnight red bull may have been a poor decision.  
just 24 hours to go to chelsea's match tomorrow. about fucking time i'd say. international football is a pain. ban it i 'd say. ktbffh
school tomorrow more like fuck you.
i don't remember seeing all you cowboys fans in august...just sayin
 ya never would have thought you'd lose 2 games when kershaw had leads going into the 7th
also since i'm watching aaron samuels on dancing w/ the stars i'm just disappointed that i didn't give october 3rd proper justice 
for all the talk of russell wilson's greatness, seattle's passing offense is 31st in league. http://t.co/ijxxincirp
school on monday! i don't want!!!! :(
 people just laughed at me at wwa but i was going mental because i was like 3rd row and harry threw water on me fuck
 i know! so sad. why are the good ones dying? i mean, why can't we trade victoria jackson for jan hooks???
we got any ole miss and mississippi state fans in the house?? if you dont, then your team just may suck.
school just isn't happening tomorrow
it's october 4th. let's be real, aaron samuels probably asked her the date then too. that guy was a tool.

still sad about jan hooks, but is it too soon to say that waitress sketch was terrible?
drinking all the red bull and still yawning and sleepy. at least it's friday?
vettel makes 6th engine change so will sit out qualy as he must start from pit row. calls the rules stupid. i'm not sure he's wrong. 
guys will think twice about bringing their familiesgiants owner said cowboys will get disease fir http://t.co/cdqysjqmj1
i swear if the cowboys win sunday i'm literally never talking to a cowboys fan again, you'll all be dead to me i can't explain
dodgers fans are annoying. kershaw may even win the mvp but when is his next start?
wow.  elizabeth pena and jan hooks in the same week.  so sad.  and both so young...makes you think.
[url=""http://t.co/o6aowvebdr""]elizabeth pena[/url]  only 55. jan hooks at 57. wtf!!! i'm getting old. stop it.  :ahhh::ahhh::ahhh:

soo pissed had a crazy day at work and i totally forgot it's october 3rd fucking aaron samuels!
  c'mon gabe im a optimistic fan but  the cats are not going to beat lsu and st that easily winning one more is hard enough
apparently the  had &amp; missed their chance in the 1st and bumgarner's back in koufax mode now. wish he'd go kershaw mode.  
so tired of chelsea and their mind games with costa injuries. watch him start and play 90 minutes tomorrow.
i may not know what i'm doing with my life right now, but i do know what songs i'd choose if i had to lip sync battle jimmy fallon.
if the wild rumours about alonso's 2015 salary being thrown around are true, that diamond encrusted mono-brow comb may be getting closer...
and so the confusion here is generated by what may be termed topical dissonance, google.
 my parents won't let me go to a demi lovato concert with my friend. also, i have a hard test tomorrow and i'm so stressed.
 yes, this is why atleti attack isn't so strong :) i'm not saying rma attack isn't great...just not as you may think.
if i die at knott's tomorrow, it won't be bc of the monsters it'll be by seeing all the cute couples while i'm alone just chillin
if you thought designing brightest windmill is jokehave your last laugh at sangam university bhilwara 9 nov 2014 http://t.co/wjjokrj10g
 agreed. although it seemed like atleti was still hungover from the juve game. any chance of the azzurri game on saturday?
anyone else remember the 155 yards arian foster had against the steelers defense the last time they faced?  i've a bad feeling about monday.
my uan was created in jul'14 &amp; modi unveiled it yesterday! he is just an attention seeker. fooling people by eating credits &amp; pr activities

: all congress party members have stopped taking bath as it may mean they are support modi's 
 for all of the moronic pats tweets, calling rex the best def hc in nfl is the worst of em. 3rd and 22 (among many examples)
the jets are 30th in points differential. have the worst pd of any nfl team that's not from florida.
jimmy fallon hasn't been funny since saturday night life and even then he was even funny. , nigga was laughing at his own jokes
arian foster suddenly q for monday night with a groin thing.. fuck
  could say moya did the same thing with worrying comment that atleti's place is 3rd or 4th. i was displeased indeed
i'm sick of bears fans that slander the packers just to slander the packers. we've been their bitch for 2 decades now man c'mon
udhav should know that modi ruled gujarat for 12 years what you have done except ""mar pit"" &amp; only to say marathi manus even not accepted.

  chowkidar modi is sun cahoots with black money hoarders

1st time disappointed with modi. : information on  given by foreign countries cannot be disclosed: centre to sc
  knott's doesn't have a corporate media empire like universal does. they may just add more stuff to the hanging now
seriously, you's fault is that alonso doesn't have his 3rd (and possibly 4th) wdc yet?? i am sure we all know the answer.
 she must be talking about lee soo man's wife, she passed away on september 30
 u turn/hypocrisy whatever  may say  modi govt close to getting what we want from the swiss .
 so the same technical point was not seen when modi was opening his big mouth in rallies ? ahhhh may be he seen names of his owner
 is no mean small incident ! state govt may not co-operate with the nia but this incident has invited  raw agency too 4 benga l

 yep,we should get niki lauda to judge nxt time.he said on sat that there's no way he would be racing if he was a current driver
arian foster / arian foster was limited in thursday's practice with a groin http://t.co/ia54t4rf33  
i may like jimmy fallon better than anyone i know too. i still hate all of you.
  just recollecting modi's speeches during may and the assurances of rajnath singh on black money. feel cheated
right down to an uncomfortably close win over the jets the pats and packers are mirror teams...both will be bounced by championship sunday
new daily reported on the 5th that lee soo man's wife passed away, succumbed to an illness.
tiff died and ariel had a panic attack and alonso went nuts and mike sat there like a barbie doll.. katie talking about after prom
sept 12 (reuters) - jpmorgan chase &amp; co said it had not seen any unusual customer fraud related to a recent cyber attack on the bank
 that 4th down play in the colts game back in 09 is one of the dumbest decisions i've ever seen
i ran into alonso at the gym. i literally haven't seen him since we graduated 8th grade. he called me nicole... man getting old is so weird
 green bay drafted rogers at about the same spot and he sat for years.  obviously a wasted pick. smh 
  aaah ...1st fixture list i saw earlier had valencia and sevilla in the same half as atleti ...must've been wrong
 2nd worst qb. definitely tony romo. the man who likes to share the ball with everyone. including the other team.

the fact i have to wait till january now for teen wolf hurts my heart
monday with no teen wolf oh okay
 crying over the teen wolf final and being sad that there is no teen wolf tomorrow
teen wolf season 5 just premiered but where is it tomorrow   oh yeah  not here
when you remember that tomorrow is monday but teen wolf isn't on
sad moment when you realize tomorrow is monday and there's no new episode of teen wolf so no moonday bummer
if you're having a good day just remember that teen wolf isn't on tomorrow.
oh look it's monday  oh look no teen wolf
it really sucks how teen wolf are making more videos in january but not now, all well! i guess i'll just have to wait.... :/
when you realise that it's no longer teen wolf monday and you have no clue what to do with your life
mondays are not the same when you don't have teen wolf to look foward to on monday nights ):
so its a monday with out teen wolf wtf am i supposed to do      
the fact that its monday n theres no teen wolf makes me so sad
the fact that it's monday and teen wolf isn't on makes me sad
crying bc it's monday and there's no teen wolf
monday's ain't the same without teen wolf
  foolish mortal, i have sat through teen wolf *and* teen wolf too, nothing you can do can harm me anymore
oh just realized that there was no teen wolf today :((((((((( major missing :(((( january'16. &lt;&lt; so longgggg
what do i do with my life since there's no new episodes of teen wolf till january
teen wolf movie series was so confusing that i thought i was listening to the 3rd movie for that past year turns out it was 
sooooo teen wolf deprived and its not coming back till january it's gonna make the next few months even slower
k so i just finished watching the 5th season of teen wolf and i've got a few questions 1) wtf was that 2) why tf is theo still alive
it's 1am i should sleep i have school tomorrow ugh i miss teen wolf, can january pls come fast already
it's already friday. not the tgif kind of friday... can time freeze for a while?
and i don't know about tgif. fridays are terrible. i'm more of a tgis person. can it be saturday already?
tgif....oh wait, i have to babysit for 7 hours all day tomorrow....
everyone's like tgif!  and i'm over here like i work tonight. and a double tomorrow. and sunday. and monday.   
...and tgif!!! what a week... i really dislike the 1st and the 3rd.
tgif but even tho it's friday i'm not happy
yesterday was lastweek,and tgif was two days ago,which was also last week, so how the hell is tomorrow monday?
this bitch said "tgif" and it's monday...
tgif is totally meaningless when you have to work on saturday..just sayin;)
 or "happy monday" or "tgif" or... how about we all just shut the fuck up for a bit? the animals will appreciate it.
i prefer tgis than tgif now. cause friday is always a stressful day
tiger woods won't win and thankfully this will be the last time we see him til october
wow tiger woods is shanking his way through the 4th round!  can't handle the pressure.
 - once again tiger woods shits the damn bed on a  saturday, sunday or both (which both is what it is most of the time)
i was 2 optimistic yesterday when tiger woods was in 1st place..predicting he'd finish out of top 10. should've been 20 
tiger woods is the biggest tease of the entire weekend. in contention and blows it on sunday. next step play 72 holes instead of 54.
i'm here watching golf hoping tiger woods can do well and this ass hole triple bogey the 11th hole!!!

tiger woods just ruined sunday for america.
   tiger woods did not play well on sunday, wait make that all year

former world no 1 tiger woods blamed his putting after struggling to an opening round score of 75 in the us pga championship on thursday
 and it just makes tiger woods look even worse than he may be.

serena has been twice as dominant as tiger woods ever was in his prime and she gets 1/10th of the accolades and adulation
 why is it because the flies are tom cruise from edge of tomorrow. try to do something die, restart.
why does tom cruise take 10,000 times to figure things out in the movie edge of tomorrow, but gets it right 1st time in mission impossible?
i would have enjoyed edge of tomorrow more if tom cruise had to start each day by re-spawning in the bathroom of a bubba gump shrimp.
finally watching edge of tomorrow nd surprise surprise, tom cruise is annoying in it
   i mean it's 5th in a series, i don't expect perfection from that or tom cruise just good action
 edge of tomorrow was yet another tom cruise movie, which is to say it was too long, blew up too much shit, &amp; needed a better end.
from the guardian: benjamin lee, 'paul haggis: "shame on" press for not asking tom cruise about scientology' http://t.co/ny1rwmhqmr
my mum's friend is here and they're legit talking about tom cruise and i'm just sat here like ........
well, at least killing the douchebag is as entertaining as wondering how many times tom cruise died in edge of tomorrow

trump is running for captain of the football team right? https://t.co/bjj2rzuki9
it may be the end of the world as we know it, but trump's feeling fine.
 if trump gets elected, we'll probably see an ayatollah give a sitting president the middle finger for 1st time in history.
tsipras may be lamenting, but europe is much farther along the dialectic than the us. shit's gradual. don't be lulled by false necessity
what makes the 3rd bailout different is that, after tsipras, there will be no one left inside greece to credibly manage the memorandum
tsipras: (on referendum) i thought no was going to win, on thursday. on friday i was certain of it
after all these tsipras headlines, i wonder if they'll still let the athens stock exchange open tomorrow. will be a total bloodbath.
  thanks. i reckon tsipras may be heading for the top three of the world's most disingenuous politicians.
do it like tsipras! ignoring problems won't make them go away; but still, you may go away with it.   https://t.co/vjn2hgcpix
 tsipras is currently on holidays and on the 6th he is going to egypt. so i dont think he realizes the situation we are in
tsipras - "talks are in final stretch"  which is greek for "talks are about to break down and i may call a referendum any minute now"
after july 13th ,really don't give a damn anymore about greek politics.don't care if it is tsipras or samaras.greece is sold to the enemy.
  on mar 23 i enthusiastically wrote the above about tsipras. now, unfortunately, i'm terribly disappointed about his leadership.
no big deal, tsipras reminds his admirers all over the world.  if possible, a 2nd emasculation won't be opposed by him.
 it's like tsipras says, they're in the middle of a humanitarian crisis. bf should have their march cancelled, and the money
 "more moderate" may be! but plenty of uneducated demagogs, who have not done a day's work....starting  with tsipras, himself!
it is not about tsipras, any more. it is about how the 3rd mou will be implemented. get over him ... https://t.co/ucpqpk235z
keep in mind tsipras' 1st state visit after elections was pope francis in the vatican.  tsipras an atheist representing orthodoxy.
dont  underestimate the power of the pple, don't be sure tsipras will win, many who voted syriza the 1st won't now https://t.co/sfaygw1k4n
   may come in handy if medvedev has to have one of those talks with merkel that tsipras is so familiar with
elections seem the most probable scenario, as tsipras made a strategic mistake... https://t.co/9wgxuytyu2 
 tsipras may just limp across the finish line in the general election because there's no real viable alternative pm...
it would be a strategic mistake of the 1st order 4 tsipras (let alone a genuine anti-austerity politician) to seek and maintain a leading ..
tsipras seemed like a teflon prime minister... but now it looks the mud is beginning to stick. by h.dixon  https://t.co/u44xsbvfib
by capitulating to the troika, tsipras didn't just seal syriza's fate, he may have sealed podemos's too / http://t.co/pgjkdfd5hc
 oh, it depends on how many people are pissing me off and the level of rage i reach! last time was friday night, about ukip...
  my area is so safely labour, you could pin a red rosette on a donkey&amp; it would still get voted in. now ukip is 2nd
far left have one thing in common with ukip mad conspiracy theory's about purges and they are the always victims  https://t.co/nka4xumpxt
 are you for real? ukip supported austerity in their manifesto! in a byelection in cornwall last night you went from 1st to 4th
bloody love europe, ukip can fuck right off! sipping a grimbergen ambre in the lyon sun whilst getting my beige on &gt; racist ignorant pricks.
i've a relative who is "traditional labour", moved to ukip in may  she's not impressed by corbyn. mythical that he can win these people back
if you did not vote ukip in may then you are a major part of the illegal immigrant problem and no part at all of the solution.....
 https://t.co/uljserilmh idiots attracted to all parties. difference with ukip is media prepared to dig through years of profiles;
there's a simple solution, just deport all the far right wing tory &amp; ukip voting cocksuckers ! https://t.co/kfan0z7s15
 went to ukip and ppl wont be fooled twice with weasel words i wont vt 4 them again it will b 1st time in 70yrs dc deceitful.
 backed by the sun &amp; closest to ukip - what does this say about the uk electorate! bigots united!
 no , ukip are just "nazi" , "fascist" , "racist" etc . heaven forbid they may have been right
 ukip is undoubtedly a threat to labour, not so tories but plaid may well hop into bed with labour to gain power.
ffs. enough. fuck the daily mail, the sun, ukip, front national and all other reactionary purveyors of hatred.... http://t.co/jtrlhgchxh
 you may not like corbyn but to retweet ukip supporters is worse. more tory than the tories
may continues to disguise her "uk out of eu" view. she should do the honourable thing and resign and join ukip. https://t.co/vqfalyg4g6
    that's the problem with ukip, they want all other eu countries to put uk citizens above 1st.
theresa may calls for curbs to eu free movement and usurps many ukip ideas in the process: http://t.co/j1fzfp89pm
so theresa may has today publicly said the same thing as what nigel farage and ukip get attacked for saying ??
so twitter, who do you think will be 1st labour mp to announce they are leaving for ukip on september 12th?? 
my ma's so fucking ukip. she may as well be smoking bensons and sipping john smith's ale as she's giving off about the chinese
ukip may be out of the news but they are as poisonous as ever https://t.co/5mi5s1bvdk one of their parliamentary candidates
ukip boy may have deleted his twitter profile, but those screenshots will be with him forever.
 they will not be safe. we will march on clapton with lead piping and beat ukip into the sea.
we've gone from a country that voted ukip into 3rd place for total votes, the party looking to seriously cut the amount of people coming in
 ukip polled 2nd in labour-held seats in the north, if we continue with tory-lite policies then ukip will crush us in the north
   you said he was the 2nd worst, he isn't &amp; ukip don't vote on non-uk issues
 to be fair paul, after snp, ukip, boundary changes &amp; 50 fewer mps, it may not be leader that's influencing the 80% who disagree
 i understand why people may support them, but i totally despise ukip. they're racist bigoted beasts, nothing average about that
  i don't think she understood ukip  at all. suggest nuttily bennett may be more in step with her views
the same ppl who voted ukip in may are only defending migrants coming to the uk because it seems like the 'conscientious' or 'right' answer.
if there were an election tomorrow,ukip still wouldnt get a great number of mp's,i hate to say it but i think this country is about finished
deplorable and wrong-headed comments by bristol's only ukip councillor. i hope he loses his seat in may and ukip fold http://t.co/l4k1gggrlm
 sorry, joe, but the only way this team finishes 7th in the big ten would be major injuries to valentine, harris and tum...
 evrn worse for people born around 14th november. just the result of a valentine's shag.
remember when i bought cute ass lingerie for valentine's day &amp; my boyfriend sat me down &amp; watched sin city instead of fucking my brains out?
valentine's day may be rather depressing for me but i barely get to see this...
it was february 14 on valentine's day, the roses came but they took you away, tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
i hope that guy goes all out for valentine's day. the fkn works. then a few days before feb 14 he checks her phone, and sees a few messages
valentine?!...it ain't even close to february yet...
one of the infinite reasons why valentine's day is the worst holiday in human existence https://t.co/rtxbo4dj1x
they think cause they said some vague shit on that friday in december that when valentine's day comes around and they're with another girl
this was the last sunday without   until valentine's day.
i think i posted surprise incest in the golden sun fanfic category once on valentine's day. i was a terrible person.
 if it makes you feeling any better....i got dumped by my 1st boyfriend, by note, right before valentine's day. :\
i get way too hype about october fuck february halloween is my valentine's day
dumbass christian thought valentine's day was on the 13th... bye
ruble sliding again today, with dollar cracking above 64 rubles, for first time since valentine's day in february. http://t.co/sl7zyvagc5
but then i remembered she's the same hoe that never gave me a valentine's day card back in the 4th grade and stole my scented eraser.
the world will end on february 14 in the year 2016. "valentine's day. bummer." http://t.co/vdmmksq82d
900 jews were burnt alive on 14 february 1349 in the "valentine's day" strasbourg massacre, where the plague had not yet affected the city
 it may as well be halloween because people are just as fake on valentine's day. boom 
see this is my struggle. don't  give me a valentine's day gift as a present, my birthday is the 16th not the 14th https://t.co/xlp7aynfbq
why would you get married on sept 11th?! if you want a 'special date', pick valentine's day like everyone else, leave that day alone.
get me valentine's day hearts for feb. 14 and i'm taking it as a sign you're breaking up with me. love won't make you eat those things.
this is the last agonizing sunday of the year. no more of these until valentine's day.

fuck it, i think it may be time to give windows 10 a try.  once i finish this download, it's time to nuke this shit from orbit.
beware - if you do not have to upgrade to windows 10 you may want to think twice before you do. we would warn you... http://t.co/b1ismtlihl
i'm in the process of updating to windows 10. close your home windows, wherever you are.....my screams may soon be deafening.
upgrading to windows 10 may be the worst computer-related decision i've made since deciding to play neopets instead of going to class.
windows 10 may be installed on 75 million pcs, but how many of those rolled back to their previous version, like me? suck it, microsoft.

serato dj isn't compatible with windows 10 yet :( ...got to spin on my old laptop saturday.
just spent 5 hours babysitting my 5th attempt to upgrade to windows 10 without success. not sure what's wrong, but it's getting ridiculous.
anyone having problems with windows 10? may be coincidental but since i downloaded, my wifi keeps dropping out. itunes had a malfunction
 if the issue only occurs with windows 10 and not your other pc or device. it sounds like the issue may be with windows 10.
upgrading to windows 10. might not be recording tonight after all. may need to cancel tomorrow night's stream to record fable.
my ad/da interface drivers just went boom!  it seems microsoft is forcing me to upgrade to windows 10. i may gone some time...
 this is on windows 10, may have something to do with it; everything else is also slower than sh** through a funnel since 'upgrade'

 he fancied rolling the ball to zlatan on the edge of the box early on and then he totally fucked up for psg's 1st goal...
fucking cunt. i hope he eats zlatan's shit in retirement league. https://t.co/blh85nzexz
 just because your hunger for more money zlatan will play in a team that finished at the 10th place and struggle for top 5,shame
watching a replay of the psg / lille match from friday. no zlatan makes psg unwatchable.
 anyway, telling zlatan he'll be the center of the team is like telling the sun it's the center of the solar system. no crap.
the top 4 strikers in the world are not for sale and our coach can't handle the 5th (zlatan)
today united should have done better, the referee didn't help at all!!!!  rooney to 10 pls! just sign zlatan tomorrow pleeeeeeze
