  and if nintendo came out and said "nope, we declare she is a cis woman" while that may make it "official canon"...
i just read a rumor that the nintendo nx may not have an optical drive, and i'm just like, "are you trying to fail now, nintendo?"
  sure, it may not be in a direct sense. but nintendo gives gx the support by sending them coverage and press releases.
i admit nintendo may have gone a bit overboard with the whole "lets give all the popular youtubers a copy of super mario maker" thing
this may be the weirdest thing nintendo's ever made. https://t.co/q7sc7dltiy

honestly, lack of 3rd party support should have been expected. its not the company's fault for not siding with nintendo
  again an improvement. i don't like barely any nintendo first party exclusives. it's all about 3rd party on all systems
 but then i suppose the 3rd party ports suffer ,maybe nintendo will use nvidia for there gfx chip... lol
  nintendo needs some more 3rd party reps, but at the same time that's what makes them pure.
 it was always a good thing but seems to scare off 3rd party devs, so nintendo need to take the risks themselves but don't &gt;
trivia&gt; nintendo - episode 137: play the game existence until the end:tomorrow never knows which games &gt;&gt; http://t.co/izecybopgu 
 yes! but it's odd.. the meeting with shigeru was in july but nintendo give them clarification to announce it now.. pikmin 4-
 don't forget, nintendo was supposed to have 3rd party support for the wiiu launch. still dumb they didn't have a backup plan
  nintendo should just pack it up and go 3rd party if its not at least 4.
i'm glad nintendo puts super guides in games, i may not use them but i'm glad people have the option of not frustrating themselves for hours
why? i really hope nintendo pays attention to it. but i do apologize in advance cause it's going to be annoying and i may loose followers
 3rd party logic dictates: "that if it makes too much sense and a nintendo platform is involved, it's simply not worth it!"
unless apple also announces they've acquired nintendo, i've got no fucks to give about any console ambitions they may have
 i don't even know where it came from, aside from metro randomly saying "nintendo are doing ios so may be there"
hahahahahahahah no but it may be a threat to nintendo ;p  https://t.co/2oljhamzde

judge argues that since tn, per scotus, can't determine what a marriage is, then it can't rule in contested divorces. http://t.co/xgocy3pvsf
even the scotus says the 2nd a can and should be restricted, david!  https://t.co/pkiupc4wu1
    and the constitution says that scotus decides what is constitutional.  we may not agree.
  the law of the land is religious freedom 1st amendment protects rf not frf. scotus was wrong. kate smith is right
  the ssm isn't the issue here. that was settled by scotus in june. this is about following the law
you say it's not a right. scotus says it is. constitution says we follow scotus. fucking done! https://t.co/iyanr58fvq
. what the 14th says or doesn't say is not up to you. the words have meanings. legally, scotus decides. they have.
 scotus determined that to be the 14th amendment's due process clause and equal protection clauses.  
anybody asking what law  broke needs to sit in on a 5th grade social studies class and learn the role of scotus.
religious freedom, purposely protected by 1st a., is now trampled by the scotus decision on gay marriage. http://t.co/uarvbr8be3
nope. look at the scotus rulings on the motto. they call it ceremonial *deism*. it's not reaffirming christianity. https://t.co/ff8ytcqbk4
 i know i'm stupid but it seems scotus has established marriage as a right via 14th. kim was denying people who legally qualified.
   legally i would say yes if you accept scotus decision and actually to litigate it that's 1st
  supreme law that scotus uses to interpret the laws made by congress. even then, congress may overturn scotus.
lol do you think scotus just sits there and eats bonbons? they ruled under the 14th ad from an ohio court ruling https://t.co/nzdhe7phyf
   actually there were many laws passed by many people in the states, scotus just ignored the 10th amendment
  here, this will explain scotus decision on ss marriage as it applied it to 14th amend.  http://t.co/wqhlbcq9ws
  and scotus ruled any law outlawing same sex marriage is unconstitutional for violating the 14th
(which is why kim lost with the 6th circuit and scotus) https://t.co/po3u10djn8
 what if scotus says 2nd amendment arms don't mean guns and elected official disregards it?
  ...the scotus could rule tomorrow that the entire bill of rights is unconstitutional and it would be binding!
 lol you still don't get it, kentucky has ratified the 14th amendment which scotus says gives equal protection to marriages.
 clarify religious freedom in scotus ruling or the 1st amendment stands in contradiction of the ruling.
scotus specifically &amp; unambiguously cited the 14th amend in their rulings on marriage equality.  https://t.co/fj8vdqg5xr
 i never said it is. but the scotus ruled that the 14th amendment requires a state to license a marriage of same sex couples
   a majority speaks for the whole court. 4 scotus judges really want to gut 2nd amendment. should they decide.
    gore lost the election 3 weeks before the scotus took bush v gore. 10th amendment argument fails
14th amendment, equalprotection and due process under the law, that and scotus declared marriage a civil right. next https://t.co/ug781xf909
 14th amendment guarantees equal protection so yeah. oh &amp;, p.s., no, scotus didn't write the law but did correctly interpret it.
   you may be right. however, lincoln didn't listen to the scotus when they said black people were not humans.
 purpose of the scotus is to establish constitutionality of laws. they ruled that gay marriage bans violated 14th amend rights
.   scotus ruled that the 14th amendment applies to same sex marriage.
    1st found guilty of violating scotus decision regarding ssm &amp; ordered to comply. then she was in contempt
   scotus has determined that the 14th amendment guarantees equal access to marriage for all citizens
 scotus would be hypocritical in re-affirming the 4th circuits ruling, but at the same time hw was kind of broad himself...
 read the 14th amendment. or maybe you should just read what the scotus says: http://t.co/1hbuefu2l4
 scotus says it is already in constitution, 14th amendment.  don't need new laws for that.
 14th amendment is the one used by scotus in the marriage equality ruling. 
searching for marriage in the 14th amendment; how scotus usurp powers that it does not have under the constitution. https://t.co/jfh4hd6fye
 which was declared unconstitutional by scotus as a violation of the 14th amendment...so that's been settled.
  bottom line, it should be a woman's right to privacy, as scotus says, for 1st/2nd trimester only.
   that law breaks the 14th amendment, so it is in scotus power to strike it down.
sorry, billionaires! might have to go all the way to scotus. pro tip: try fully funding your projects next time.  http://t.co/8zvji7wbzv
 if the scotus decided that the 14th a gave a muslim woman the right to no longer wear a head scarf, or that marriage
   as the scotus has interpreted it,the legislation in the 14th amendment protects same-sex marriage
 you may want to learn about what the scotus does.  
 scotus based their argument on the 14th. no matter how you stretch it race was not involved.
  scotus has interpreted equal rights under the 14th as such.
   the states ensured scotus could take this action by enacting 14th amendment
 and the 14th amendment as interpreted by the scotus protects gay marriage.
 scotus interprets laws, and since by their interpretation it is protected by the 14th amendment it is technically a const violation
 wait what?!?! scotus makes laws!?!? since when? have i been lied to my entire 8th grade year about gov? (sarcasm intended)
  ?regardless of your position,protocol should be followed in all scotus decisions.next time it may be one you don't like
 in 8th grade i learned that scotus rulings have the force of law. they never got that far.
 read the 14th admendment, thats were scotus says the power for gay marriage lays. in the due process clause and equal protection
 you are aware that scotus said that it fell under two sections of the 14th admendment right?

i may hate me some taylor swift, miley cyrus, and katy perry but i love some carrie underwood because she know how to stay in her lane.
part of me thinks nicki is so serious about her attitude towards miley tho. she may be cool with her but she was a little serious. 
nicki may need a wardrobe change if she plans on winning anything else tonight. 
miley better pick up the hannah montana wig again because that may be the only she'll hide from nicki.

i want nicki to fight miley on a national awards show so bad and tonight may be the night
1st time i've watched the vmas in years .. what, did nicki just....
literally 1st time i've ever watched the  miley called nicki out on her crap, and i respect that.  
nicki just gave this pastor a shout out but didn't attend sunday school last sunday. man please.
nicki &amp; tay may be friends but i'm still not a fan like was nicki for real about miley this is too much for my emotions im so confused 
what these white people at school tomorrow have so much to say about nicki!!!!! 
stop it nicki said all that behind a smile https://t.co/vdewp6arle
like miley said she didn't look into everything but she thought nicki may have been subbing her but she didn't know for sure. her words.
 watch: even tho that was nicki responding 2 miley putting her on blast 1st the media will make it out like nicki picking a fight.
 i'll tell you more tomorrow but miley was throwing shade at nicki and nicki just called her out
i'm team nicki but i would never openly say something bad about taylor swift because i think she may have snipers on retainer.
so the 18th will the best weekend, jason aldean and     
my mom stood up to congratulate nicki then she sat down when she heard taylor lmao
when that whole thing with nicki and miley, i sat there and just thought "damnnnn shots fired"

tfi friday - not half as good as it was 'back in the day'. all seems rather self-indulgent towards chris evans these days (even more so!)
anyone taking their kids trick or treating tomorrow and would take briana with them for a little while?
david bowie may be the only rock star to wear a wristwatch on stage  chet flippo, on the '83 tour
chris evans with 33 yd td run. taylor w 2 pt conversion. 14-14 with 7:59 left in 3rd qtr.
      i wonder how many kids will be  tomorrow night ..thor with a  hat on ;)
thor is cruising and we are hosed...see you all tomorrow at 2-1
yes, thor, i remember those 6th inning stats of yours. let's lose them tonight, hey? 
hate to admit it but arod is good in the booth. interrupted harold talking about thor costumes for the 8th time and provides real insight
thor just giving me my 16th heart attack of the night. it's okay, just some candy corn lodged in my valves this time. 
rios grounds out to end the inning. should be all for thor with colon and neise on bullpen. still 5-3 mets in 6th.
thor said thursday during press conf that he had tricks up his sleeve for tonight. it was the warthen slider, he relied on it heavily 3 ip+
 there's no way thor should start the 7th anyway
harold reynolds talking how the 1st pitch from thor sent a message, sure if you forget the royals he 6 hits in the first 2 innings
 me. i am a caitlin face tonight, but a thor face tomorrow.
how about the balls on tc to stay with thor with bases loaded to get that 3rd out!! 
if yoventura had done what  thor did on the 1st pitch to esky he would have been villainized. instead, thor is a hero. 
  kinda hoping matz pitches inside tomorrow, though he's a different pitcher than thor
 you must have heard thor's comments on the 1st pitch he's not afraid that much we know
matz needs to come out firing  like thor tomorrow  first pitch in the same place   
i don't know who but someone is partying with fat thor tomorrow
 i just heard a quote that the royals intend to get back at the mets for the 1st pitch tonight please tell curtis to be careful!
curtis will see you saturday 
dark souls spooky scary halloween party in chasm of the abyss tomorrow! [all platforms] https://t.co/nmxyija04s
david bowie may have tucked  into bed as a child--listen--bigtime players on the left did to yours truly too.
 a normal hard slide into 2nd would be comparison to thor pitching inside,utley comparison would be if he actually hit him in the head
 no more than when curtis or murphy had to dive in the 1st 2 games.
  thor's single with 2 strikes leading off the 3rd is what should tick them off.
halloween bingo with curtis will begin at 1pm in the 1st floor activities room today
  you guys just hit the ball well and thor settled in after the 2nd.
curtis with their 3rd 3-and-out to start this one
  thor will have sack up in april when he watches the royals raise the ws banner on opening day.  want tickets?
rummel recovers curtis fumble. it's pouring out here. maybe the weather had to do something with that. 2:04 remaining 3rd 21-7

curtis going for it with a 4th and 6 coming up.

 .neymarjr may make barca return against malaga: coach http://t.co/wowkamuexs via toisportsnews http://t.co/ydgppvhn2s
yo! chelsea! remember when barca said fabregas was poo poo in the 2nd half of the season. no refunds
vermaelen starting for barca 2nd time in a row. didnt think he'd play that much for them.
 that he's a 4th choice cb at barca and has started two games?
 think they put him number 3/4 these sky sports pundits are pro barca,  spent ages talking about messi's win on thurs.
we now just need less than 4.5 goals in the barca match and real match to land the 32/1 7-fold. i may cover our bet before the last match
i hope that barca does a lot more better in the 2nd half then in the 1st half.
i honestly think what we're seeing with fabregas is really him and why barca were quick to part ways. last august-november was a one-off
i can't believe the last time barca scored against malaga was in january 2014, that's odd. my money on malaga to win tonight 
again, awful from barca. not the best result, they should get 3 goals or more. calderon on the 12th, serious.
pedro sat bench for barca &amp; kdb wins poty in germany but yet pedro is the "better" player.
barca on the other hand could have problems. must avoid injuries and stay in touch til jan and probably add 2 more on top of arda an vidal
at least we won't face de bruyne for wolfsburg in the champions league, or against city when they get barca in the 2nd round
 i look at his past record 2 n it's awful nearly got barca relegated nearly finished 5th wif bayern b4 he got sacked
   do you guys think if barca reaches january as leaders they can win the league and whether team can achieve that
 did you not see my reply? barca's front 3 tomorrow. don't even @ me.
 yer some argentinian kid from barca is flying in tomorrow, apparently traore has told him it's good at villa.
does barca's transfer ban expire after tonight or on the last day of december?
  if he can play then i hope he plays against barca, on the 20th
so de gea will be just like the barca situation, can't play but is basically at the club because he should leave when january comes
if ddg is stuck here till jan, can we offer him to barca just to annoy madrid even more.
madrid and barca run the la liga, not a chance ddg won't be a madrid player by tomorrow.
of course it will be, when barca can sign a player inspite being banned from signing, why not real get 1 minute. https://t.co/c6kxxmyffb
   personally i think utd should just tell madrid, the deal is gone and then in january sell ddg to barca
barca fans when they saw "uefa will study the case tomorrow. they will make a decision on the de gea case" http://t.co/bmv0wbjeoy
  .. which they won't do as they are facing a transfer ban akin to barca. even de gea going january misses the cl.
barca won the treble and had a transfer ban yet they signed two players. arsenal came 3rd in the bpl and they didn't buy an outfield player
 barca turned down the opportunity and experimented with suarez. bayern haven't opened a cheque yet[have 1st preference]
 he's a fraud who will be gone by may. bet you weren't saying this when he was at barca
ben lederman may well end up being the first american to play for barca but, for the time being, it sounds like he's heading to florida.
  he's off to barca in january
atletico madrid is going to be dangerous..pedro leaving is going to hurt barca in the long run..no bench to rest msn https://t.co/td02tabov8
.://pinurl.co/makemoneywithgooglejr may make barca return against malaga: coach http://t.co/u00nuzqqat
yea, just play for u21 when the club asks, u may had won a lot wit barca but that is past, tis is unitedddd(spartaa) https://t.co/e2h731h3uz
can only mean one thing: he is joining barca - probably in january.
 psg could be the 2nd best team in the world behind barcelona but they always get barca lol, so we would never know
  exactly. only reason torres even came back into the lime-light were for 1st minute goals vs madrid &amp; barca
arda turan got cramp, i am not surprised! sign for barca but can't play til january, what do you expect lol
 the thing though is if pogba ever does leave juve it will be to barca, also my team isn't in 13th place right now.
we are not real barca or bayern that players would be ready to join the club as a 2nd/ 3rd choice. on what grounds would you bench coq/santi
neymar was always gonna be something special. i honestly hate his role at barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to messi
barca want midfielder, forward in january http://t.co/aywd4snfpm

'sneak attack by roger' (sabr) causing errors this game for federer. may be it's isner's height 
in french open qf, federer didn't break serve -- 1st time in slam match in 13 years. tonight he breaks for 1st time in his last return game.

he's still wrong about sting :) https://t.co/sgqnnxstdz
sting will interfere and cost undertaker the match this sunday. or, it's possible we could see the return of the masked kane. 
sting defeat the  9-4 ... on to fullarton tomorrow night to face the 
 interference seems a foregone conclusion to set up a 3rd match at wm...unless sting shows up tonight and screws taker.
if sting is on raw tomorrow then there is no doubt he will confront the undertaker to build towards a match at wrestlemania.
pwinsider reports that several sources indicate sting flew back to new york city tonight, which could mean he appears at raw tomorrow night.
   --instead responded to sting's statement. "hai, sting-san! may the guild with more--
sting may be apppearing tonight how many times have we heard that in the last 2 months? i'll believe it when i hear the crows.  
 if sting is in a rollins story line who's the next rumored 3rd man for reigns/ambrose?
i gotta mute   on monday's. good to see sting sucks it was in twitter. i guess back to san andreas it is.
sting wins title and vacates it the next night on raw goes in to hall of fame in april....
 did you notice how the upper corners of sting's paint were gone b/c he was in there so long?  "c'mon seth, take it home."
 we've already been getting christmas stuff in at work so i assume we're just prepping for black friday even earlier and sting is
 cena with that broken nose. and if sting is in the title chase, paul (hhh) may have killed that cena-rollins feud.
 c'mon you wouldn't mark out if sting was champ? granted i realize rollins ain't dropping the strap to him but for nostalgia?
 do you guys think "the icon" sting will actually get his 1st victory in wwe? if so, when and where will he get it?! 
maybe if sting had her on monday his facepaint would've made it to 11pm http://t.co/yi7hkahvfc
when it comes to weathered instruments, there's brian may's guitar, sting's bass, and motorhead's lemmy
see they should have announced sting's appearance last monday beforehand. say he will address wm and his future. tease retirement.
 me and a daddy deano went to see sting and paul simon. 4 blokes behind us talked for the 1st 15 mins. absolute dicks. why?
wonder if sting will be able to speak with his actual voice on  on monday, or if they'll dub him over like a movie trailer again.
i hope sting spends his time at  tomorrow complaining about how long he had to stand behind that curtain while  went on &amp; on

i live in perpetual fear that any of the people i interact with on a daily basis may have voted ukip
i guess the great british public who voted labour instead of ukip in may can thank their lucky stars that we don't have a lab/snp gov now...
if you didn't vote ukip in may ten you are partly responsible for what's happening in calais today ukip would never have tolerated it......
people can't grasp that perphaps by sending representatives to eu parliament that aren't from ukip, we may just wield more democratic power.
  ukip was on media blackout for most chanels they didn't want people to know how well ukip really did we came 2nd
don't worry about results tomorrow my dad got an a in politics and still ended up voting for ukip
  great article.. u forgot ukip, who will take all the votes of disaffected tories. labour may just scrape a win

leftist hypocrisy of the day: "the mail's 'corbyn's 1st 1000 days' is a viscous smear. channel 4's 'ukip's 1st 100 days' was good, though"
  well, whatever their reasons for voting ukip, they can't have been the latter (though may have been former).
 york central was i think their 6th target in the country (stupidly high i always thought), they got 10% on par with ukip.

 labour amendment, likely supported by the snp, green and ukip. some eurosceptic tories may support it - it'll be close

 oh c'mon, you all know exactly what i meant. i never said zlatan should be benched in 1st place. it's about possibilities.
 zlatan!  cavani has been unhappy about playing 2nd fiddle to ibrahimovic... he's signing a new contract! zlatan to mufc?
  ronaldo -ramos - zlatan - muller .if you could pick one to sign tomorrow , who would it be ? http://t.co/sipagvjjlm
lol aulas still mad about the penalty zlatan took a 2nd time a few month ago. i'm delighted by the fact that he is still butt-hurt about it!
further: zlatan is the captain of the mon-stars. (the plot involves him recruiting demons to take over world soccer).
 thoughts about the aubameyang rumors? cover if zlatan leaves? or adding depth? augustin a good 3rd striker for ucl quality?
non issue": man u playing against psg on thursday, niggahs will get thrashed like shit, zlatan and cavani gonna castrate you"
one word from zlatan and he will keep quiet  " lmaoooooo hazard 3rd best? make zlatan catch mourinho fes."

 hey jennifer. what is your source for your article about zlatan will be in istanbul on the 6th of aug. thanks a lot.
  coz of zlatan talking how he loves a fight. may make him show lvg just how he is truly world class.
i don't want to wake up tomorrow, without zlatan.  
ibra recovery time is still unknown, the french league starts on friday. psg will play lille, zlatan is very much in doubt for that.
 sure, someone who scored more goals than zlatan and edinson would be 4th string lol you retard
 i didn't buy your club to invest in zlatan. i shall visit china tomorrow &amp; gift you a china-made zlachan  8)  
  considering i'm 31st, it looks like zlatan's about to disappear.
zlatan's 20th goal of the season not enough for who concede twice late on to draw 2-2 with caen...
 manager neil lennon has said saturday's 0-0 with derby , illustrates just why he's been chasing zlatan &amp; neymar all summer long 
 that &amp; zlatan insisting on playing through pain for the 2nd half vs. lyon. why not just come off? 2-0 up anyway.
 any truth to galatasaray having made an informal offer to psg for zlatan? is he fit to play this sunday?
 that 3rd shot looks like its from a michael bay movie. zlatan just revealed himself to be optimus prime.
apparently zlatan may leave psg for united. he's already at a team that buys every high rate payer and wins fuck all, not sure why he'd go.
oh no, we supposedly pull out of pedro deal as zlatan becomes available. please god i'll go church every sunday if u make this not happen
sun are so full of shit they say psg trying to replace zlatan with neymar hahaha
 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of de gea. but not enough time rather try for griezmann. wont mind zlatan for a year !
 i didn't think they will sell either. maybe rabiot but surely cavani doesn't want to play 2nd fiddle to zlatan anymore
 with mario rejoining milan surely there's no room for 2nd reunion with zlatan which therefore clears the path straight to utd
 i don't want it to be but it may be austin. obviously prefer zlatan, muller, lewandowski etc 
we held talks with psg on thursday for zlatan name now confirmed to me but this is two days old news
zlatan is looking mighty attractive at the moment,if lvg doesn't get a striker by tuesday, i really don't fancy us scoring goals this season
if wenger is in paris. could it be for cavani or zlatan?then again he may be on a family break.
goal level: zlatan  90k by friday? = posting every other day   (vine by ) https://t.co/bpum3a8tsd
 wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.he can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to zlatan but he's not worth psg asking price
rib injury for zlatan against russia is a big blow if he misses austria game tuesday. a chance for new sunderland striker toivonen 
noooooo! i was hoping to see zlatan being zlatan in tuesday! oh well, still looking forward to the match.  https://t.co/swgyd9cqaj
 zlatan has never done it on a wet tuesday night at stoke tbh
  how many goals zlatan intends to serve into the net on friday. to know how to bet 1 &amp; 3 + or 1 &amp; 4+ ????
