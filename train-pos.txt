 seems fitting that there's a parallel there, and that scotus used 14th amendment to override the 10th. 
.'s friday first hour focused on the scotus unconstitutional redefinition of marriage, and the case of  excellent!
   and that's why scotus has the last word on what laws states may enact and enforce. hence "supreme court."
   scotus never made law they interpreted it. 14th a guarantees equal rights for all americans
 i may have missed it if u posted it but what's ur take on  situation &amp;  claims about scotus ruling

awesome day in central park. looking forward to seinfeld tour and then nxt takeover brooklyn tomorrow   
to quote seinfeld's kramer, monday has a feel; wed has a feel, and friday has a feel. here's to feeling the first friday of the school year!
kramer is the best character on seinfeld. george close second, newman 3rd.
popcorn and seinfeld sounds like the perfect friday night... 
someone needs to make a video compilation of all the sat vocabulary cosmo kramer spontaneously uses on seinfeld

 what a waste. it even has the last man on earth, seinfeld, south park and monday night raw. hulu is awesome

little brother just asked me if i'm down to binge watch seinfeld...there goes my sunday night lolol.
 i've been watching seinfeld since like the 5th grade
 hulu you say? this and seinfeld alone may be worth reactivating my subscription
 i may have read that in the way that seinfeld greeted newman.
 haha! seriously, though, it reminds me of the seinfeld character jimmy. "jimmy liked worship this sunday."  
 something has been bugging me lately. what if seinfeld was current day? what if brand new episodes came out every thursday?

 i went to see mission impossible rouge nation today, i really enjoyed it. have u seen it? i might go see ant-man tomorrow?
lavalantula is genuinely better than pixels. i have laughed so may more times and not at it but with it. the guy from sharknado showed up
 new iron maiden album on the 4th of september~ has their longest eversong on it, which is why that reminded me.
it's the first of august and started off good with ant-man.

the fact that bailey is bringing dunkin into work tomorrow, is the only thing keeping me motivated to wake up in the morning.
i feel like brock lesnar may be the only boyfriend that's safe dating rousey.

rousey obliterated correia on saturday! is she the most dominant  fighter ever?  
  can confirm first-hand, paul mccartney was fantastic on friday night. worth dealing with the human detritus.
december 5th could be the biggest ufc card put together. aldo &amp; mcgregor, and rousey as a co main event with her possibly fighting cyborg.

wow. new jay pitcher david price comes as advertised. 8 innings, 11 strikeouts, 1st win as a blue jay! bring it!

my monday has consisted of paul mccartney on a loop in my head and craving honey barbecue boneless wings with ranch from bdubs
    i'm going to see paper towns for the second time tomorrow.i love this movie.(love you cara!)
if you're having doubts about ant-man, just go and see it, you won't be disappointed. he may not be a major character, but the movie is good
john kasich may be the most genuine of all of the candidates 
looking forward to monday night raw, the return of brock lesnar (and ).

lord  and i killed the floor friday when bad blood came on!
nicki did that for white media idgaf . nicki may act like she don't give af but she cares what the media thinks
i used to bump nicki aalllll the time in middle school. pink friday was my fav
ice cube and o'shea are gonna appear tonight may the lord have mercy on my soul. they're so damn fine.
nicki is truly a loving and forgiving god, may we all show the same mercy she has shown to taylor to those who have wronged us. amen.
i loved ice cube's son's comments about people who didn't get that "bye felisha" originated from friday 
i'll set my dvr to record the encore so i can watch nicki's performance tomorrow.
nicki is the most talked about tonight and will be tomorrow. no doubt!

  i hope you have a wonderful sunday night as well,  shawn
nicki is so hot and out of all the fine qualities she has, her teeth just may be my fav one. not her butt, but her teeth.
cue the mountain of thinkpieces about nicki's "aggression" and "internalized misogyny." looking forward to tomorrow.
kanye taught everyone to be fearless, so be fearless. 2020 i'll be 20 if election day lands on the 4th. my vote? kanye west.

nicki may have called miley out but miley's messages tonight were much more powerful than any performance at the vmas
kanye west is for real the one pop culture topic i ever argue with my (usually pretty cool) mom about. and that'll happen tomorrow.
kanye west may be a good rapper, but eminem is the rap god

crew gets a fumble at the 4, murray and the o can't punch it in. kick a fg to make it 17-7. may be murray's team now. crew has been awesome.
we have the break ! murray breaks bellucci to 30. serving for the 1st set at 5-3 !
assuming murray pulls it out here all 4 matches on monday will be very intriguing.
murray with another huge 1st down run, 26 yds
a lot has happened while i was away sprain-spraying my ankle. murray has taken the 1st set 6-3 in 50 mins &amp; is up a break at 2-1 in the 2nd.

 i like pumpkin muffins from dunkin!  would thursday or friday be good for you??
red sox score eight in the 4th where has this been all season?! these guys are having fun out there!  http://t.co/nji0c19szs
murray d. bellucci 6-3 6-2 7-5. much better play from the start compared to his last match. very tamed match. into 4th round. 
bellucci played a great 3rd set but murray was just too good. he advances into week 2 with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 7-5 win

1 set up and has already broken murray in the 2nd. this is beautiful from kevin
 i'm not a huge fan myself but you know murray will probably comeback in the 3rd &amp; 4th set knowing him.
 trash ol? theyve looked excellent so far. trash rbs?j-stew ran for 486 yards in the final 5 games last season, 2nd only to murray
murray has this. he may not have it at the moment but i'm not worried  
super super super excited about gay pride on the 19th too mf hype.

4th set point in this game and  challenge called in. anderson 2-0 sets. murray much more promising at the end of the 2nd. he's not out yet!
what an effort from murray in that 2nd set. got to take the momentum from the last few games into the 3rd.

there you go! murray breaks back in the 3rd. can he make another comeback here? looooong way to go!  #
murray breaks again!! back to back breaks in the 3rd set, game face on!
 concerned. if murray can win this 3rd set, i think/hope he can win the match :)
just as i say how good anderson has been, murray goes 3-1 up in the 3rd. of course. 
yoga tomorrow at 7:30 pm at illuminate! i can't wait to see you guys there!
i start school tomorrow and i'm only going because i don't want nicki to be mad at me
15-30 on murray's serve, but the scot more up than down finally and grabs the hold of serve with a couple of aces.  andy up 4-3* 3rd set.
ice cube is a genius tbf, didn't know he actually wrote the screenplay for friday
really great match this now. anderson is going for broke on every murray 2nd serve, and murray is winning most rally points now. 
konta has started well, at least on her own serve. murray has a big moment at 4-4 in the 3rd, down 2 sets. 
murray does well to hold. 5-4 to murray. anderson to serve to stay in the 3rd set 
 if murray takes 3rd set i think he'll win
lets go andy! murray wins the 3rd set, down 1-2.  
murray takes the 3rd set, game on!
get in!! murray take the 3rd!! (anderson leads 7-6 6-3 6-7) 
we're going to a 4th set!! murray just dominated that tiebreak, wins it 7-2. he's pumped up now!!  
but! murray takes the tie break in the 3rd set and we've got game on! http://t.co/tzkvtmqmkl
murray stays alive! he wins the 3rd set 7-6!  
come on !! tempted to make my way across to flushing meadows on wednesday if murray comes back to win here! 
 the later i stay up the better...c'mon murray!
 it's why i love tennis. one minute looks like murray is down and out. next minute anything is possible! c'mon 
yoga can help your child concentrate at school. research shows that the deep breathing exercises may improve children's focus.
 definitely although i think if murray does enough to win the 4th set he'll go on and win it.
tomorrow kicks off 5$ class week! come try out our new morning classes. slow burn yoga with barrett starts at 9:30 tomorrow am!
it may only be the round of 16, but holy cow! don't tell that anderson and murray! incredible match! 3hrs and 40min so far. 
might be watching monday night raw just to hear john cena's entrance song...
this murray vs anderson match is great. 4 hour match and it's still in the 4th set.
biggest game of the match. even bigger than the 3rd set tie-break. murray simply had to hold. please andy.

almost friday, which means it's almost jason aldean time!  
so in order for  to beat the  derek carr has to have a perfect game, he needs to run for 1st downs. murray needs to shine
in the words of chris evans. t f i friday.......  &amp; tonight we party. free entry* | free shots
anyone else thinking chris evans is just doing this series of tfi friday before giving it to nick grimshaw?! 
the 1975 may as well just call it a david bowie cover
i'm sure  are all a bit mr happy tonight seeing chris evans' t shirt tonight on tfi friday.  https://t.co/hkcgxfmcuo
nice drive lead by chris evans and 2 pt. conversion good to make it 14-14 7:59 left in 3rd    via 
alright people, you've been waiting for it. dark souls. 1 death = 1 jalapeno. tomorrow at 11am pst.  rip me. https://t.co/9whelmpcid
grandy showing some real nixe range our there in rf, saving a 2-out double to end the top 5th. 12 straight retired by thor. 
 2nd visit to david bowie is last night and i already feel like i should be going again! absolutely amazing exhibition! thank you! &lt;3
away. away. away. syndergaard peppering outside of the plate and then busts pitches inside. thor has found his groove. 5k. top 6th.
regardless of what happens- thor's recovery from the 1st and his middle innings here give me hope for the future  
 he was like david abbott's edgier younger brother.  the elvis costello to david abbott's george harrison, if i may.
finally home from all this so called shopping in time to see thor finish up the 6th
people who know baseball know thor is the player of the game cause after the 2nd inning he started dealing and kept mets alive
put it in the books! big games for the captain, thor, and granderson. let's got matz tomorrow! 
nice win, thor, captain america, and the falcon came up big , let's even this up tomorrow. 
the first one is always the hardest. way to go thor!! looking to tie it up tomorrow night!   https://t.co/lpnqoxri1a
i knew thor would get the job done. matz on tomorrow, offense seems to be waking up, let's go mets!!! 
here we go boys!!! great job by thor tonight!!!! and the captain!! huge spot for the long island kid matz tomorrow.
what's nice about cy pitching tomorrow night, he won't lose focus like ventura did after thor singled. we can't go to a game 7 with yv
win tomorrow and we get another shot at a 3 game set with harvery degrom and thor 
i want to dress up as thor tomorrow and wear a syndergaard jersey.
i knew that escobar attacks 1st pitches, so there you go, hit this one.. thor is a real life hero. 
thor is the man, this guy may have single handidly just turned this around with that first pitch
i like how thor is bragging about making esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings.
thor is a throw back kind of pitcher. i love it!!!!  https://t.co/eam51lnbhr
i'm loving all these quotes from the cry baby royals about thor's 1st pitch to escobar. if i'm matz, i'm doing the same thing saturday.
so proud of everyone tonight. it's not the end of the season it's the beginning of a new one. game next saturday against curtis 7 pm mt. t
  great game &amp; way to make a statement on the 1st pitch.  very bob gibson of u. beware of thor the hammer will come! 
 i hope you're ready for march 24  because that's when i transmute into dark souls danielle
 today's my 21st birthday and it would be awesome if i could get a birthday reply from thor!

neymar playing his last game for barca before he signs for us on tuesday i see 
let's go barca 1 goal before the 1st half ends.
 surprise, surprise! barca has the upperhand, but it seems malaga has their 12th man, the ref is so bias.  
soccer saturday! watching barca with my nerd right now and then going to see the armada tonight!
vermaelen the hero for barca: thomas vermaelen was the unlikely hero as barcelona laboured to a 1-0 home win over malaga on saturday ...
    barca may have more points but real madrid play the better football
 did florentino perez make the schedule in la liga? barca's 1st 4 away games all against top 8 teams; rm plays sevilla &amp; 3 creampuffs.
 same. knackered. i'm going into town tomorrow to watch it. probably go barca on the locks. where you watching it?!
 hey ben really enjoyed your set in barca last night, what was the 2nd last track you played? sounded like caribou?
had great time in barca, also made some profit which is always nice. back to the online grind for the sunday today  
return of sunday morning watching the lad play footy. all week i picture them playing like barca, the reality is very different. 
 this is the roma i wanna see vs barca in rome on the 16th. the match will be epic.
   what chance nolito ?? or is he off to barca in jan ?
done my balls in barca but still treated myself to a five euro 1st class upgrade on the fast train to madrid. 
(assuming barca are the best team in the world) who is the 2nd best in your opinion?
 it solves part of the problem but the jigsaw still has some big gaps that need addressing by 6pm tomorrow! enjoy barca!
for football fans, it's transfer deadline day. for us, barca fans, its just another monday :v
plus, atleti still killing it. my heart may belong to barca but i love the competition. first place may not be so predictable. (2/2)
 very true i wish they would accept but i think we have a shot to get him in january and fight barca for him what do you think?
barca may have the best players, but they are miles away from having the best team. look at that shit def.  https://t.co/n3ufl2xiam
  barca will successfully defended the title, with the arda and aleix in january plus msn i don't see them lose.
he was in the atletico academy, real is the biggest team in europe next to barca. all his friends are in madrid. lol https://t.co/aichwltiu8
 its the dogs, ye its amazing and defo go to a barca game, the 1st footie game ive enjoyed in years
definitely liverpool's anthem is the best, 2nd is barca's one, love it!
 he should come out in press now. and may be sign for barca or city. :d
then everton will get the player from barca on loan :) https://t.co/n1voycdfiy
 equally he's d 2nd most expensive under21s(after neymar's barca move)&amp;3rd most expensive signing in manu's history 
 it is true 4th biggest behind barca, rm and manchester united with over 50m fans
  here's the thing if you put barca and madrid in the epl it would be exactly the same in la liga barca 1st
 loooool phones a myth. in venice today, going to nice in the morning then going barca on saturday for a week. also send money
friends of barca, i'm off on saturday to travel round spain so would like to see as many of you as possible... http://t.co/birddhrbuf

 still got smacked by barca. wolfsburg went far in the europa and bvb lost to finalists. epl is 3rd.
fifa sunday!  psg or barca all the way 
the tenerife vs. barca femeni game has commenced. jenni hermoso scored for barca in the 5th minute. tenerife 0-1 barca. 
barca beats joventut 86-77 in 1st preseason game. marc garcia and demond mallet led all scorers with 20 points each
 boo hoo... in barca at the moment! the bar doesn't open sunday and monday's! go home tuesday. 
 the chap is in his 2nd season of a 3 year deal. he has done the business at barca and munich and i'm sure he will do it for us.
 he'll be ready in january for barca!!
can't wait for arda to play with barca, january na pls! https://t.co/rwrrfgdnf0
 so neymar being fifth and eden being 6th shows nothing other than barca did better than chelsea in the cl.
 he should walk straight to barca's 1st team.
slowly getting my last bits pulled together for barca! gonna get everything finalised today so i can just relax tomorrow :)
  may all the power of barca and messi be with you this season!
neymar shockingly starts playing for brazil like he does for barca https://t.co/rsuke3s16i

dierks bentley and eric church at ! happy 22nd birthday to me! is it july yet?
murray has given it his all, which wasn't expected after the last few days he has had but federer just unbreakable. tb 2nd set. 
federer stays winning. into the finals tomorrow.
federer beats murray 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach  final. he'll be going for his 7th title vs novak djokovic, who is going for his first
way to go roger. old man federer just keeps rolling along.  v.  for the final tomorrow. 
djokovic v federer should be good one tomorrow. fancy the swiss, can't see djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
federer will play another final tomorrow. this guy is just amazing. 
excited for the federer vs. djokovic final in cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. should be some great tennis!
serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets. joins djokovic and federer in tomorrow's  singles finals. decent trio.
love this new trick that federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve. running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal!
some outrageous shots from federer in the tiebreak. the clean half volley return of a djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
federer breaks early in the 2nd set! even consolidates the break! up 3-0!   
federer's a man with a mission... 7th one coming.. 
tiger, federer, serena, the niners (eesh about those guys), and some cold tx brews. laaazzzy birthday sunday.
for the 1st time, federer has beaten no.1 and no.2 players in the atp rankings in consecutive matches en route to a title. 
federer is my 2nd fave male tennis player of all time right after the great arthur ashe.
what a great day for world sport: usain got his 9th gold, federer claimed cincinnati title no 7 and i pumped some weights. 
new  tomorrow, reviewing federer, serena and the pre us open storylines. this is what we sound like https://t.co/2x0o2udce8
add to the results, federer over djokovic  and lewis hamilton, and it's not a bad sunday at all!
23rd of august was such a nice day, england lift ashes, bolt won 100 m and federer beats djokovic in cincinati.
papa you need a hat thus said one of federer's twin girls.......congrats again for winning cinci for the 7th time 
federer overtakes lendl for second longest streak of being seeded at the us open in the open era. 15th straight year. connors leads with 18.
 looks clear cut for federer though. but 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against stan or murray
all though federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter i think gasquet 200/1 looks big 
 i believe federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
federer is looking good after winning cincy for the 7th time.
federer back for 16th us open: federer hopes his us open first-round encounter against the argentine goes much... http://t.co/czmyueveqs
you'll love this.   federer, murray, serena, djokovic. its got it all.   https://t.co/4hducxvfip

  novak is surely the man to beat. federer or murray may run him to the base line. the usual suspects.
i believe  could win a 3rd  title if he can make it to the semifinals at least because of federer, murray, etc. 
     the u.s. open is rockin..nadal tonite, federer tomorrow
how to watch federer and murray on tuesday at the 2015 us open: roger federer will begin his 2015 us open on t... http://t.co/glxqkdijzn
 federer faced the highest ranked guy in r1. his draw is tricky. so is murray's.if fed reaches the qfs, then he may meet berdy.
i'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch federer's game tomorrow!
yes, federer's attacking return is brilliant.  but yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
not going to be able to watch federer's match vs darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the swiss.
 federer is about to begin his 2nd round. go watch it.
darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. well, one kind of bleeding because federer's still leading.
federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the hewitt vs. tomic match takes!
jo konta's win over muguruza was the longest ever women's  match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as federer's entire match! woah!
federer defeats darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd round at the  accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd round
last year, majority of the federer matches took place primetime.  this year, it's the other way around.  2nd on ashe tomorrow
 i keep trying to book as soon as i learn when federer's playing - too late. nosebleed seats for 4th round (!) going at $250.
the 1st week of the 2015  is almost up &amp; the big names of serena, venus, djokovic, murray, federer &amp; wawrinka are still in the draw.
 i may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than i just saw, nadal, federer and djokovic included. make no mistake,
fognini is i believe only the 3rd one to beat nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others (no points for guessing) federer and djokovic.
federer breaks the kohlschreiber serve!! federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set 
good starts for federer and stosur. berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!
wow, tragic start from federer in the 3rd
just like in the 2nd, federer breaks back.
roger while having trouble with serve, he is still through to 4th round! federer might face isner in 4th round
 i concur with your coach. its you!  good luck tomorrow against federer!
federer defeats kohlschreiber 6-3 6-4 6-4 to go through to the 4th round 
federer advances into fourth round at us open: in the blazing new york sun, federer seems to be in his element... http://t.co/coiduhkll4
federer's second serve placement is awesome. that's why he's the best server ever. nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve
gonna have to dvr this isner and federer match... this thing is good. getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. 
federer saved 4 bp (from 0/40) and holds for 2-2 in the 2nd set.
ok time to check back in with tennis - isner and federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak
federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. leads isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) 
i watched federer calmly destroy a dude at the us open on thursday, and it was amazing. i still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
i believe the loss at rg to wawrinka was first time in a decade federer didn't break once in a gs match. this might be the 2nd. 
that ending of 2nd set tb by federer, he really is the original son of jor-el
wow, federer wastes 3 bps with 3 isner's 2nd serves. fed 0/8 on bps tonight
federer's 1st serve is just...perfect. 
federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... lol wow
 it's weird that in the 1st set federer &amp; isner went game for game until the tiebreak. then federer trucked him in the tiebreak
federer breaks his own record with a 14th appearance at the atp finals after reaching the us qf  http://t.co/ugi3pqbp8w
with his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure federer will crush gasquet in the qf. c'mon federer!! http://t.co/lhcehzo26g
. honing his game on p3 court for his match with federer tomorrow.  http://t.co/amklvtlaqx
federer plays tomorrow, so i guess i won't talk to you until thursday because you'll be busy drooling

finally washed off all the blood. i had so much fun running around as abigail today. decided i'm doing nigel and hannibal tomorrow.
hehhe heres the last of the hannibal stickers im making.. ill reopen my store with all the hannibal designs tomorrow! http://t.co/zpgaqfrset
i start college tomorrow. i think today is the best day to start watching hannibal
 has been a brilliant series tho &amp; the fact we don't know if hannibal is still alive leaves door open for a 4th season 
 oo i need to get back in to hannibal! did season 1 then just kind of stopped. yar, started last week. you got kids in tomorrow?
i'm getting up at 6 tomorrow so i sticked in and out hannibal after i realized next episode has the girl waiting under beds to murder people
holy shit i just now opened the hannibal's kitchen envelope someone handed me friday night   http://t.co/v8dx9jl0pv
 based on the 1st ep, mr robot seems a good series to go on to.it looks to respect the audience in the same way as hannibal, a least
 dexter is great but give hannibal another try, it gets better after the 5th episode :p
 michael marshall shot the hell out of the hannibal finale. (this movie rules. loving maddin monday)
while i was at taco bell i got to thinking about hannibal. i might not be ready to watch the finale but maybe i could watch the 2nd to last.
ok so maybe i'm watching, for the 1st time, the 1st episode of the 1st season of hannibal and oh my lord what is this
 thank you my love! and i have had a fab day! distinct lack of hannibal but i'll put that right tomorrow! xx
i'll be sending off summer and hannibal tomorrow. it'll be a bittersweet day.
 i pretty sure none of those fans regret not being there to see harper strike out in the 9th on a pitch in the dirt.
i don't much like harper but he is right to do this. https://t.co/cpgyeqfdzm
sherman or harper: who knows the strike zone better? my column: https://t.co/stzfrxnxin
  if u keep harper as pm i may well cross the lake myself! u have one incredible leader. balanced budget and all!
 if you're interested... mansbridge's harper interview. justin tomorrow, mulcair wednesday. http://t.co/hujjpagmzd
c'mon... it's pretty hard to form the harper govt without harper!!! wait... maybe they have another harper...  https://t.co/vomvlajaot
bryce harper is 0-18 against matt harvey. harper will lead off the 3rd inning against harvey. http://t.co/adeeldzeoj
harper was right lol, nats leave in the 7th
big spot for harper now in the 7th to impress the fans left in the park
 still have the 9th &amp; top of order!  harper walkoff homer!
ok, last chance for the  it's werth, rendon, harper vs. familia in 9th, down 8-7.
werth, rendon, and harper due up in the bottom of the 9th,  trail mets 8-7.
i hope all the fans stayed into the 9th to watch harper go 0-5. 
 rendon bunts but werth is erased at 2nd. runner on 1st with 1 out.  harper at bat...
 telling why you should trust harper. worth the 10 min. to listen. not after eating, though. http://t.co/zg540pzviu 
    but he's certainly been the 1st or 2nd best player in the nl overall, harper and kershaw better.
 harper putting up historic numbers. thus far it's been a series to forget at the plate, but, again, he didn't pitch the 7th.
 harper gets first chance, most seats won get 2nd chance. easy. harper does not play well with others, ask danny williams.
    keep focus on harper&amp; all these good things will be added unto you may the best man who wins the heart of canadians

i was in like the 4th, 5th, 6th grade burning cds and mixtapes that faithfully consisted of dipset, old bone thugs, and hella jay-z
jay-z may not be the best looking guy, but he proves to others that looks aren't everything

my following may not be as big as jay-z's but i got a solid supportive growing following. thanks for the love. 
the 1st dance at my wedding will actually just be a duet of diamonds from sierra leone-remix with my husband as jay-z and myself as kanye.

the best part of living in new york is the nightlife. the 2nd best part is knowing that jay-z and beyonce share the same weather as me.

jay-z sat in that interview like a god showing that he was truly ahead of his time while the other niggas flirting with foxy brown

including his tna title wins, sting is a 14-time world champion. beating seth would tie him with cena for 2nd of all time.  
great raw tonight...1st the dudley boys and then to end with sting!!!    
sting winning at  results in either sting vs taker at mania or sting vs cena and i've got a bad feeling it's the 2nd option
sting is back, and the dudleys return :d quite an eventful monday night raw on the whole. lesnar-dallas though x'd
